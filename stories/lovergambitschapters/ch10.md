The room is bathed in a warm amber glow as the sun descends slowly behind the mountains. Dust particles drift lazily through the golden beams. A soft breeze enters through the half-open window, ruffling the curtain just enough to stir the stillness.

Ariv sits cross-legged on the rug, his back against the sofa, scrolling casually through his phone. The reflection of the screen glints in his eyes, but then something shifts. His body tenses—just slightly. Like a shiver brushing past his spine.

He freezes. Thumb hovering mid-air. His expression morphs from casual to alert—like prey sensing a predator before the growl.

**DK** *(sipping from his cup, watching with mild curiosity)*:  
What happened? It's like a snake just crawled over you.

**Vir** *(leaning back on his elbows, puffing smoke toward the ceiling, eyes narrowed)*:  
...What now?

**Ariv** *(barely above a whisper)*:  
She called me.  
He swipes. Swipes again.  
More than ten times. And… she’s sent me a whole essay worth of messages.  
He slumps slightly, rubbing his forehead.  
Ah, I’m so fucked.

**DK** *(snorts)*:  
Yeah. You’re seriously fucked right now.

**Vir** *(without breaking eye contact with the drifting clouds)*:  
Every day’s a funeral, huh.

Ariv dials the number, the ringing echoing in the stillness. His legs bounce nervously, a reflex. DK leans in, nosy.

**Ariv**:  
She's not picking up.

**DK** *(mock-concerned)*:  
Maybe she’s been kidnapped.

**Ariv** *(shoots a glare so sharp it could cut glass)*

The call connects.

**Ariv** *(suddenly alert)*:  
Hello?  
Hello, you there?

He strains to hear. The background hum of traffic filters through.

**Ariv**:  
I can hear car sounds… If you're not in the mood to talk, that’s okay. I’ll cut the call—

**Swasti** *(voice cutting in like thunder)*:  
So, you still have the guts to call?

**Ariv** *(eyes widening)*:  
I was sleeping...

**Swasti** *(flatly)*:  
Who sleeps this late?

Ariv glances around the room. DK strikes a mock halo pose. Vir stifles a laugh.

**Ariv** *(casually)*:  
We all three.

**Swasti**:  
Oh. I thought you were dead.

**Ariv** *(grinning)*:  
We recently started a relationship, and you already want me dead?

A pause. A heavy, thick one.

**Swasti** *(with a sigh)*:  
There’s no point arguing with you.  
Where are you right now?

**Ariv**:  
The usual.

**Swasti**:  
I’m coming. We need to talk.

**Ariv** *(eyebrows lifting)*:  
Oh, okay.  
By the way… where are you right now?

**Swasti** *(calmly)*:  
Near the turn.

**Ariv** *(instantly)*:  
Good. Get me a pack of cigs.

**Swasti** *(irritated)*:  
Don’t smoke that much. You’ll die of cancer.

**Ariv** *(pretending to be moved)*:  
You really are hell-bent on killing me now.  
And people who smoke don’t die of cancer.

**Swasti** *(already done with him)*:  
Then how do they die?

**Ariv** *(cheerfully morbid)*:  
They die from heart attacks.

**Swasti** *(snaps)*:  
If you already know that, why are you still asking?!

**Ariv** *(mock tragic)*:  
Well, what’s the point of living when my life’s already fucked?  
My girlfriend’s like a demon—I mean, always angry.  
Might as well aim for peace in the afterlife.

A silence. A dangerous one. Even the breeze seems to pause.

**Swasti** *(low, cold)*:  
Who are you calling a demon?  
Don’t think I didn’t hear that.  
And how the fuck do you expect to go to heaven?

**Ariv** *(smirking, defiant)*:  
I don’t want to go where you’ll be.  
I want peace, at least after my death.

The anger radiates from the phone like static. DK instinctively takes a step back. Vir slowly puts his cigarette down.

**Swasti** *(gritted teeth)*:  
Just you wait… I’m coming.

**Ariv** *(cheerfully unfazed)*:  
Don’t forget the cigs.

Click. The call ends. The silence returns, heavy as a tide.

Vir stands up with a slow exhale, brushing ash off his pants.

**Vir** *(to DK, calm but firm)*:  
It's better we leave.

**DK** *(already grabbing his slippers)*:  
Yeah… he poked the hornet’s nest.  
I don’t want to get stung.
