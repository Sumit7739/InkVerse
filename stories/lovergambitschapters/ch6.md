**(The room falls silent after the playful teasing. Ariv and Vir are sitting at the table, each chewing thoughtfully. The atmosphere shifts as the plan is about to be discussed, the light-heartedness replaced by a palpable tension.)**

**Ariv:** *(looking up from his plate, voice low and serious)*  
"We'll start the plan today. You ready?"

**(Vir, who had been messing with DK, looks over at Ariv, his playful demeanor dropping as he meets Ariv’s gaze. The room feels heavier now, the clatter of utensils fading into the background.)**

**Vir:** *(nodding slowly, his tone grave, eyes focused)*  
"Yes, I'm ready."

**Ariv:** *(leaning forward slightly, his tone calm but firm, his hands folding neatly on the table)*  
"All the preparation is done. We follow the plan from here."

**DK:** *(leaning back in his chair, arms crossed, with a worried look in his eyes, voice tinged with concern)*  
"What if he finds out during the act?"

**Ariv:** *(without hesitation, his gaze unwavering as he locks eyes with DK, his voice calm but authoritative)*  
"I'll make it work. Just do your part properly."

**Vir:** *(glancing over at Ariv, then at DK, his voice soft but serious)*  
"So, when do we start? Meeting him during class hour is impossible. He's always surrounded."

**DK:** *(rolling his eyes, tone dripping with sarcasm, but also a hint of frustration)*  
"Yeah, he's always surrounded by those... butterflies. I don’t know what they see in him. I’m much more handsome than he is."

**(Vir and Ariv share an exasperated glance, their eyes narrowing in mock disbelief as they turn their attention back to DK.)**

**DK:** *(looking at them, frowning, almost pouting)*  
"What? I’m not handsome? My girlfriend says I’m the most handsome."

**Vir:** *(snorts, shaking his head with a knowing smirk, voice dripping with sarcasm)*  
"I think your girlfriend needs to see an eye doctor. She really, really needs it."

**DK:** *(eyes widening, half offended, half amused, as he gestures toward them)*  
"Hey!"

**Ariv:** *(cutting in mid-sentence, a subtle smirk tugging at the corners of his lips, his tone sharp but playful)*  
"I think she just consoles you so you don’t feel bad about your face."

**DK:** *(his face twisting into mock betrayal, hands dramatically clutching his chest as if wounded)*  
"Even you, Ariv? I never thought you’d backstab me like that."

**Ariv:** *(shrugs nonchalantly, his tone cool but matter-of-fact)*  
"I’m stating the truth. And truth is always hard to digest."

**(Vir, trying to hold back his laughter, lets out a soft snicker, shaking his head as he looks at Ariv with an expression of amused disbelief.)**

**Vir:** *(chuckling lightly, glancing at Ariv with a playful glint in his eyes)*  
"So, have you tested it?"

**Ariv:** *(nodding without hesitation, his expression turning more serious, voice steady but confident)*  
"Yeah, I’ve been working on it for a few days. It's ready."

**(Ariv shifts in his seat slightly, then turns to DK, his gaze intensifying, the weight of his words clear.)**

**Ariv:** *(his voice steady, almost commanding)*  
"Dk, it’s all on you now."

**DK:** *(nodding, his face serious but tinged with a bit of uncertainty)*  
"So, when do we surround him?"

**Vir:** *(his voice dropping, laced with a bit of frustration, leaning forward slightly as if measuring his words carefully)*  
"Meeting him during the day or class hour is impossible. Based on the intel I’ve got, he visits the convenience store often in the evening to get his cigs."

**Ariv:** *(nodding thoughtfully, his eyes narrowing as he processes the information)*  
"How many will be with him?"

**Vir:** *(his gaze flickering slightly as he recalls the details, voice soft but matter-of-fact)*  
"He usually goes with one person. I’ve seen him there several times."

**DK:** *(leaning back in his chair, an exaggerated look of disbelief crossing his face, his voice filled with mock shock)*  
"When did you go there?"

**Vir:** *(flustered now, his cheeks flushing slightly, voice defensive but soft)*  
"I went with my girlfriend the other day, okay? I saw him there."

**DK:** *(raising an eyebrow, his tone amused and slightly mocking)*  
"Huh? Who goes to a convenience store on a date? It’s such an odd place."

**Ariv:** *(gives DK an exasperated look, voice slightly irritated, but his tone still playful)*  
"Think outside the box, DK. He might’ve gone there to pick up something for his date."

**(Vir now looks completely flustered, his face turning a deeper shade of red as he avoids eye contact.)**

**Vir:** *(defensively, his tone awkward)*  
"Hey, we’re talking about him here, why are we talking about me?"

**DK:** *(grinning mischievously, leaning forward on the table with a mock serious expression, eyes narrowing as he presses the point)*  
"No, no, this is important too. So, if I’m right, you went with your girlfriend there to get balloons. Am I right?"

**(Vir goes completely silent, his face flushing bright red, a mix of embarrassment and surprise. He can’t bring himself to respond.)**

**Ariv:** *(leaning forward, voice playful but teasing as he raises an eyebrow)*  
"Yeah, the balloons you use to achieve nirvana. Am I right?"

**DK:** *(laughing, shaking his head with a mock appalled expression)*  
"Hmmm, pervy boy."

**Vir:** *(glancing at both of them, trying to maintain composure but now thoroughly embarrassed, mutters through gritted teeth)*  
"Don’t act like you don’t do it with your girlfriend."

**DK:** *(smirking, leaning back in his chair, fully aware of Vir’s discomfort, voice matter-of-fact)*  
"Yeah, I do. But I don’t hide it like it's some kind of demonic ritual."

**Ariv:** *(genuinely curious now, his eyes focused on DK, his voice softer as he asks a more thoughtful question)*  
"Hey, by the way, how does it feel?"

**DK:** *(his expression turning a little more serious, eyes distant for a second as he reflects, his voice steady but deep)*  
"Hmmm... it’s hard to explain in words. But, in short, you’ll feel like you’ve achieved nirvana. It’s like tasting immortal nectar."

**DK:** *(looking at Ariv with a small, sly grin, voice low and teasing)*  
"Yeah, you should try it once."

**Ariv:** *(raising an eyebrow, his tone dry but slightly amused as he leans back in his chair)*  
"I’ll think about it... but my situation doesn’t allow for that right now."

**Vir:** *(laughing softly, his tone playful but with a hint of warning)*  
"Yeah, don’t even try it with her, or we might never find your body afterward."

**DK:** *(nodding seriously, his face breaking into a mischievous grin as he leans forward to deliver his final, mock serious advice)*  
"Yeah, you should control yourself and stick to first base, at least until we’ve sorted this out."

then they all leave for there classess

**Scene: 3:00 PM – University Cafeteria, Rooftop**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm, golden hue over the university café perched on the mountainside. The open rooftop buzzed with laughter, plates clinking, and the distant hum of wind brushing against pine trees. From up here, the valley sprawled endlessly below, framed by snow-tipped peaks that looked like painted strokes.

 **DK** and **Vir** sat with their girlfriends, caught in animated conversation. Laughter erupted every few minutes—DK teasing Vir, Vir shooting back with exaggerated expressions, their girlfriends either giggling or playfully smacking their arms. Their world was full of color and noise.

At the other side of the table sat **Ariv**, alone.

He twirled his fork into the half-eaten pasta absentmindedly. His eyes weren’t on the food, nor the people. They were fixed on the distant mountains—silent, unmoving, as if waiting. The sun painted half his face in light, the other half cloaked in soft shadow. Wind played with his hair, but he didn’t seem to notice. He chewed slowly, like someone buying time.

Then—soft footsteps.

A shadow fell beside him. **Swasti.**

She slid onto the bench next to him without a word, placing her bag down gently. The table didn’t shake, but the air around them shifted. Even the laughter from DK’s table dimmed slightly, as if the moment had cupped its hands around them, shielding them from the rest of the world.

**Ariv** blinked, broken out of his trance. He turned and found **Swasti** smiling at him—her smile, not the playful, teasing one she wore for others. This was a quiet, knowing smile. The one only he got to see.

**Ariv (quietly):**  
"Why are you sitting so close? Go sit on the other bench."

**Swasti (tilting her head):**  
"Why? Do you own this seat?"

He looked at her for a second longer than he should’ve, then without a word, slipped his arm around her waist and pulled her closer.

Swasti’s eyes widened.

For a moment, she didn’t know how to react. This wasn’t like him. Ariv never allowed too much closeness, even when they were alone. And now… in public?

**Swasti (softly):**  
"You’re quite bold today."

**Ariv:**  
"I’ve made up my mind. No more running."

She blinked, and for a second, the mountains, the café, the world blurred. Her heartbeat drowned out the noises around her. Her cheeks flushed pink, and her lips parted as if to speak—but no words came out.

Ariv picked up a forkful of pasta, gently raised it toward her mouth. She hesitated… then leaned in and ate.

There was something sacred in the silence that followed.

Ariv glanced over at **DK** and **Vir**, who had been watching quietly. Both stood up. No goodbyes. No drama. Just a nod. A signal.

**Ariv (to Vir, without turning):**  
"I’m counting on you both."

**Vir** nodded subtly.  
**DK**, one hand raised in a lazy wave, called out without looking back:

**DK:**  
"Don’t mess this up, lover boy."

**Ariv’s** lips curled into the faintest smile.

Swasti turned to him, puzzled.

**Swasti:**  
"What was that about?"

Before she could get more out, Ariv raised another forkful to her lips.

**Ariv:**  
"You look more beautiful when you're not speaking."

She rolled her eyes and chewed in protest, shooting him a glare.

**Swasti:**  
"You’ve changed since yesterday. Does my kiss really have that much power?"

**Ariv (softly):**  
"Yeah... it did."

Swasti’s smile widened, glowing now.

**Swasti:**  
"I knew it. So what’s the occasion today? You’re… unusually sweet."

He said nothing. Just kept feeding her, one bite at a time, as if savoring something more than just a meal. His eyes were steady, but distant—like someone memorizing a moment.

She caught his wrist mid-air, frowning now. Her voice dipped lower.

**Swasti:**  
"Don’t tell me you’re still thinking about the breakup. This feels like giving food to a lamp before sacrificing it."

Ariv snorted, almost choked, then coughed lightly, wiping his mouth with a tissue. His laugh faded into a deep exhale.

**Ariv (gently):**  
"No. I’ve made up my mind… I’m going to pursue you. Do everything I can to keep you with me."

The words hit like a wave.

Swasti froze. Her fork clinked against the plate. For a heartbeat, she forgot how to breathe. The world slowed, sounds muffled. The wind against her skin, the heat from his body beside her—it all blurred into static. She could feel her cheeks reddening, a stupid smile crawling up her face before she could stop it.

She reached to hug him.

He stopped her gently, a hand on her shoulder.

**Ariv:**  
"Not here. Too many people."

**Swasti (half-whispering):**  
"So what?"

**Ariv (with a slight grin):**  
"I feel shy."

She shook her head, leaned closer, and whispered like a secret:

**Swasti:**  
"You’re cute when you’re shy."

**Scene: Rooftop Café, University – Late Afternoon**

The sun had dipped slightly lower now, casting amber streaks across the sky. The breeze had picked up, ruffling napkins, tugging lightly at Swasti’s hair. The smell of brewed coffee and sun-warmed concrete hung faintly in the air.

Ariv leaned back on the bench, elbow resting lazily on the wooden table. His fingers tapped the glass absentmindedly.

**Ariv (glancing sideways):**  
"So what are you doing here? Isn’t your class going on right now?"

Swasti sighed, looking off into the distance, voice quieter than usual.

**Swasti:**  
"I can’t concentrate on the classes anymore. Just needed some air... a breather."

**Ariv (brows furrowed):**  
"And why is that?"

She turned to him, lips pressing into a half-smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

**Swasti:**  
"You really have the courage to ask?"

**Ariv:**  
"Did I do something wrong?"

**Swasti (softly):**  
"It’s because of you, dummy."

Her voice lingered in the air. Neither spoke after that.

The two of them glanced around, suddenly aware of each other’s presence—their shoulders barely apart. Their eyes didn’t meet, but both were blushing faintly, hiding behind casual gestures. Ariv looked down at his drink. Swasti toyed with her bracelet.

**Swasti (after a pause):**  
"So… how was last night?"

**Ariv (without looking at her):**  
"Meaningful."

She leaned in slightly, intrigued.

**Swasti:**  
"Anything specific?"

**Ariv (shrugging):**  
"I don’t remember. I drank a lot... Slept like a log."

**Swasti (raising a brow):**  
"That’s disappointing."

**Ariv (softly):**  
"Well… I missed you. A lot."

Swasti froze for a second. Her breath caught.

He’d never said something like that before—not with this softness, not without a joke tied to the end. The words were small, but they carried weight.

She gently reached over and placed a hand on his mouth, her touch feather-light.

**Swasti (teasing, but voice trembling slightly):**  
"You’re getting quite cheeky... saying flirty things like that."

**Ariv (smirking):**  
"Well, you asked me."

**Swasti:**  
"You’ve never said things like this before."

**Ariv (meeting her gaze now):**  
"As I said... I stopped running from it."

The breeze danced between them. A few strands of her hair floated across her face. Ariv, without hesitation, reached up and tucked a strand behind her ear. The moment lingered.

**Ariv (softly):**  
"So... how was your night?"

**Swasti (half-laughing):**  
"Hmm. Meaningful. Drank with my roommates. I don’t remember much after that."

**Ariv (mockingly):**  
"Wow. You don’t even know what you did, and you're saying it was meaningful?"

**Swasti (raising an eyebrow):**  
"Okay, then tell me—did you look at my photo and blush while hitting the bed?"

**Ariv (with a sly smile):**  
"Hmm… I did."

She wasn’t expecting that. Her eyes widened slightly, color rushing to her cheeks.

He looked at her, enjoying her reaction.

**Ariv:**  
"Yeah… I blushed like that. They made fun of me."

Swasti, trying to keep her composure, looked away, flustered.

**Ariv (leaning in):**  
"So… did you do that too?"

She didn’t answer. Just nodded, quickly, embarrassed.

**Ariv (grinning):**  
"Expected."

He stood up, brushing his jeans.

**Ariv:**  
"Wait here. I’ll bring something to drink."

**Swasti:**  
"Hmm."

**Ariv:**  
"What do you want? Hot or cold?"

**Swasti (smirking):**  
"The environment’s pretty cold today... so bring me something cold."

**Ariv (pretending to ponder):**  
"That equation doesn’t seem to check out."

**Swasti (flashing a mischievous smile):**  
"Don’t mind it. You’ve already made me hot with all that flirting."

Ariv held back a chuckle, raising a hand like a knight at court.

**Ariv:**  
"As you wish, my lady."

He walked off.
