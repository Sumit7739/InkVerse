### **INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

The lighting is dim. Shadows stretch across the room as the remnants of a long night linger — glasses half-full, ashtray overflowing, the air thick with smoke and unspoken words.

Ariv sets his glass down with a slow, mechanical clink. He reaches for a cigarette — the motion familiar, practiced. The flame sparks, igniting the tip. Smoke coils around his face like a veil, briefly hiding whatever storm brews behind his eyes.

He doesn’t look at anyone. Just exhales, then speaks.

**ARIV** _(low, deliberate)_  
"So... how’s the preparation going?"

The shift is instant. The teasing dies. Silence spreads like ink in water. DK and Vir exchange a brief glance — no need for context. They all know exactly what Ariv means.

**VIR** _(leaning forward, calm but serious)_  
"I’ve got intel. Sent a decoy after him. We’re watching his moves."

Ariv nods slowly, his eyes narrowing just a little. The cigarette hangs at his lips, untouched.

**ARIV** _(quiet, calculated)_  
"Hmm. The situation’s changed. We’ll have to pivot. Adjust the plan."

**DK** _(leaning back with a smirk, voice edged with irony)_  
"Can’t even break up properly and now all our plans are in shambles. Bravo, Ariv."

Ariv doesn’t react. Not outwardly. But there’s the faintest shift in his shoulders, like a man quietly absorbing a punch.

He takes a long drag, exhales through his nose.

**ARIV** _(voice softer, reluctant)_  
"I tried, DK. Honestly. But she... clung harder than I thought. And I "  
_(he hesitates)_  
"I got softer."

He looks away. A faint flush creeps up his neck. He rarely stumbles over words — but now, even breathing feels like confession.

**DK** _(snorting, half-mocking)_  
"Look at this guy. Mr. 'Cold and Calculated' turned into a puppy."

**VIR** _(cool, grounded)_  
"Let bygones be bygones. The path may have changed, but the destination remains the same."

DK gives him a look, head tilted, a grin crawling back.

**DK** _(tapping his temple theatrically)_  
"Alcohol really brings out the philosopher in people. Why can’t I speak like that? Why am I not wise?"

Ariv and Vir exchange a glance. A shared smirk. No words needed — they’ve been through too much.

**DK** _(mock defensive)_  
"Don’t look at me like that. I’m not an idiot. Scored 80% in boards, remember?"

**VIR** _(raising an eyebrow, deadpan)_  
"Still lower than ours."

**DK** _(shrugging dramatically)_  
"That’s 'cause you two had no lives. I had priorities. Social balance. Healthy lifestyle."

The humor fades. Ariv’s eyes darken again, jaw tightens. He taps ash into the tray.

**ARIV** _(focused)_  
"Vir, let’s set it in motion."

Vir picks up on the tone immediately.

**VIR** _(cautious)_  
"You sure? This isn’t the original plan. Things could spiral."

Ariv stubs out his cigarette with quiet finality. His hand lingers for a moment, curled into a fist before relaxing. He meets Vir’s gaze directly.

**ARIV** _(steady, certain)_  
"I’ll handle it. Just stick to your part."

DK leans forward, his grin turning into something more solid. There’s respect in his tone now.

**DK** _(slapping Ariv’s back)_  
"Now _that’s_ the confidence I like to see."

Ariv exhales, the weight of camaraderie settling on his shoulders. He leans back, letting the comfort of old friends seep in.

**ARIV** _(low, resolute)_  
"You guys are my confidence. With you two... I can take on anything."

DK swirls the last bit of whiskey in his glass, his voice dropping a notch — blunt, but not cruel.

**DK**  
"So... you sure about her? I mean, looking at your history... it’s disappointment after disappointment. What makes this time different?"

Ariv lights another cigarette. He doesn’t meet anyone’s eyes — just watches the smoke spiral upward, lost in thought.

**ARIV** _(quietly)_  
"I don’t know, man. I really don’t. Maybe fate’s already decided. Guess we’ll see."

Silence falls again. Thick with memory, regret, and that quiet ache of history repeating.

**DK** _(matter-of-fact)_  
"You know who we’re up against. And honestly... I only see one ending here."

**VIR** _(snapping, sharp)_  
"DK, don’t. You’re killing his morale."

**DK** _(shrugging)_  
"I’m not mocking him. I pity him, if anything."

Ariv lets out a hollow laugh, eyes half-lidded, voice tinged with resignation.

**ARIV**  
"History’s consistent. Every time, someone will take her away. Maybe it’s fate. Maybe I’m just not meant for this love thing."

Vir silently pours another drink and slides it across the table toward him.

**VIR**  
"Drink. Stop overthinking."

DK raises both hands, sensing tension.

**DK**  
"Okay, okay. My bad. If it _does_ happen again... just screw this dating mess. Ask your parents to get you married."

Vir shoots him a glare so sharp it could cut glass.

**DK** _(grinning)_  
"Alright, alright. I’m done. Total silence. Shhhh..."

**VIR** _(to Ariv, softer)_  
"Ignore him. He gets mouthy when drunk."

**DK** _(mock offended)_  
"I’m not an idiot."

**VIR** _(deadpan)_  
"Yes, you are. Zero filter. Just full broadcast mode."

Ariv chuckles, but it’s faint — the kind of laugh that never touches the eyes.

**ARIV**  
"It’s alright. He’s not wrong. Sometimes... the truth helps. Even if it stings."

Vir places a hand on Ariv’s shoulder — steady, grounding.

**VIR**  
"Don’t spiral. Drink. Sleep. We’ll figure the rest out tomorrow. With clear heads."

### **[INT. HIS APARTMENT – MORNING]**

The room is a mess. Bottles and half-eaten snack packets lie scattered on the floor. The window’s slightly open, letting in the soft golden light of morning. It's 8 a.m. A gentle breeze flutters the curtain as birds chirp somewhere outside.

On the bed, three guys are knocked out cold.

DK is draped over Ariv—one leg across his stomach, an arm over his shoulder like a clingy koala. Vir lies at the edge of the bed, untouched by the chaos, like someone meditating mid-apocalypse.

A phone buzzes with an alarm.

A hand shoots out and silences it. Vir blinks awake, rubs his eyes, and squints at the light. He glances at the tangle of limbs beside him—DK wrapped around Ariv like a comfort pillow. A faint smile touches his lips... then fades as he takes in the room.

Empty bottles roll across the floor. Snack wrappers flutter in the wind.

Vir exhales. There’s an unspoken rule in the house—whoever wakes up first cleans up the mess. And since Ariv and DK sleep like they’ve been buried in a tomb, it’s almost always Vir.

He sighs, gets up, and starts picking up bottles. One has a little drink left—he lifts it, sniffs it, shrugs, and downs it like a man who's found the last drop of life-saving elixir.

He tosses the bottle in the trash, lights a cigarette, and grabs a broom. The clinking of glass stirs the dead.

Ariv blinks awake, groans as he finds himself coiled in DK’s grip again. He slowly peels DK’s arm off, then shoves his leg aside. DK grunts but doesn’t wake.

Ariv sits up and looks around. The room is already half-clean. Vir stands near the desk, broom in one hand, cigarette in the other, staring out the window like a tired father watching his children ruin everything.

Their eyes meet.

Ariv lifts a lazy thumbs-up.

**VIR**  
Why don’t you come help, _for once_?

**ARIV** _(yawning)_  
What's left? Just sweeping. And I believe in you. You’ve got this.

Vir doesn’t even blink.

**VIR**  
You guys only know how to eat and drink. Not clean.

**ARIV**  
Don't be salty. I _was_ planning to clean today.

**VIR**  
Then why are you still on the bed?

**ARIV**  
You woke up before me. What can I do now? Fate chose you.

**VIR**  
Go wash the dishes before the stains fossilize.

Ariv slides off the bed and stretches like he’s in a yoga class.

**VIR**  
I swear to god, I’ll dislocate a few of your bones.

**ARIV** _(smirking)_  
Jealous of the physique, huh?

**VIR**  
Start washing, or I’ll beat the crap out of that “physique.”

**ARIV**  
Relax, relax. No need for violence.

He walks over, takes the cigarette from Vir, takes a puff like it’s therapy.

**ARIV** _(exhaling)_  
Mmm. That’s the good stuff.

**VIR**  
Watch your step—crumbs all over.

**ARIV**  
Oops.

He flicks the cigarette into the ashtray and heads to the kitchen, tying on his favorite apron like it’s armor. He starts doing the dishes, whistling the same off-key tune he always does. The kettle’s on, water heating up for tea.

In the background, DK turns over and mutters something in his sleep.

Ariv doesn't even look back.

**ARIV**  
(quietly, to himself)  
One day... I’ll wake up last.

**[Interior – Morning – Soft classical music plays low in the background. The sun filters through the curtains.]**

**Ariv** is in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, sipping coffee between scrubbing dishes. **Vir** hums quietly as he brooms and dusts the room. The rustling and clinks stir **DK** from his sleep. He sits up groggily on the mattress, rubbing his eyes.

**Vir** (without turning):
“Get out of bed. I’ll fold the blankets.”

**DK** (groaning):
“What’s the rush?”

**Vir** (checking the wall clock):
“It’s already 8:20.”

**DK** (stretching with a loud yawn):
“Oh. Well, I guess it’s time to wake up then…”

He gets up, scratching his back lazily and shuffles into the kitchen.

**DK** (peering into the fridge):
“Do we have any drink left?”

**Vir** turns to stare daggers at him while folding the blanket with military precision.

**DK** (backpedaling):
“Okay okay, don’t get mad…”

DK then grins mischievously and sneaks up behind Ariv at the sink.

**DK** (teasing):
“You look like a housewife doing all this. So... what’s for breakfast today, *my darling?*”

He gives Ariv a light slap at the bottom.

**Ariv** (flinching, flustered):
“Hey! Maintain your damn dignity. Don’t touch people like that!”

**DK** (laughing):
“Oho! Now you *really* sound like a housewife... offended by another man’s touch.”

Ariv stares at him, red in the face.

**Ariv**:
“I swear I’ll beat the shit out of you.”

**DK**:
“With those delicate hands? What’re you gonna do, throw a pillow at me?”

He wraps his arms around Ariv from behind, overly dramatic.

**DK** (sniffing):
“You smell good. Did you change your shampoo?”

**Ariv** (struggling, half-laughing):
“Stop acting like some lusty old uncle!”

He shouts out toward the living room:

**Ariv**:
“Hey Vir! You sure DK’s not gay? ‘Cause the way he’s acting…”

**Vir**, who’s been silently watching the whole thing unfold from the doorway, raises an eyebrow.

**Vir** (deadpan):
“I don’t know. Maybe we should ask his girlfriend.”

**DK** (startled):
“Hey! Don’t bring her into this! I was just messing around.”

**Vir** (smirking as he folds the last blanket):
“Well, I think we should tell her. Might be a little shocking... but she deserves to know the truth.”

**Ariv** walks out of the kitchen, coffee mug in hand, nodding with mock seriousness.

**Ariv**:
“Yeah, we should inform her. ‘The man you love... might actually love men.’”

**DK**, still in the kitchen, panics a little, fumbling for words.

**Vir**:
“You’ve seen how he cuddles you at night, Ariv.”

**Ariv** (quickly):
“Hey hey, don’t bring me into this! He’s the one coiling around me!”

**Vir** (trying not to laugh):
“But you never resist, do you?”

**Ariv**:
“I *do*! I’ve even slapped him in his sleep!”

**DK** (mock hurt):
“So *that’s* why I wake up with a sore cheek sometimes…”

**Vir** (grinning):
“So... who’s gay here?”

**Ariv**:
“No one’s gay, damn it! Enough. Let’s make breakfast.”

**DK** (pointing dramatically at Vir):
“I think *he* is.”

**Ariv** (raising an eyebrow):
“Oh? Why?”

**DK**:
“He keeps his distance. Doesn’t even let anyone *accidentally* touch him in bed. Always sleeping on the edge, like a chastity monk.”

**Ariv**:
“That… doesn’t make any sense. But... suspicious.”

**Vir** plops down on the chair, expression deadpan.

**Vir**:
“You know what? I’m changing my room. I can’t live with these two idiots.”
