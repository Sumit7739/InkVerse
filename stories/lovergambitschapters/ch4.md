**[INT. HIS ROOM – MOMENTS AFTER SHE LEAVES]**

He sat in the quiet, her perfume lingering like a question he couldn’t answer. The silence stretched, thick and humming with everything unspoken. The door had clicked shut, but her presence hadn't really left.

His thumb hovered over his phone screen for a few seconds, then tapped the name without thinking.

**He calls his friend.**

**dk:** Hello?

**He:** Where are you?

**dk:** Near the shopping complex. Do I need to grab something for you?

**He:** Hmm. I wanna get drunk tonight.

**dk:** What? Why?

**He:** Just… I don’t know. I need something hard.

**dk:** I’m with her right now, can’t leave immediately. But I’ll call Vir and ask him to bring you something.

**He:** Alright. Just make sure it hits hard.

**dk:** Something happened?

**He:** …Hmm.

**dk:** Wait, I’m coming right now.

**He:** It’s not urgent. Are you staying at her place tonight?

**dk:** No, I’ll drop her off and come to you.

**(In the background, dk’s girlfriend’s voice filters through faintly.)**

**dk’s girlfriend:** What’s going on? Are you going somewhere?

**dk:** Yeah, I won’t be staying tonight.

**He:** You don’t have to come. Just ask someone to get me a bottle.

**dk:** Bro, you can’t even tolerate water with spice. I’m not letting you drink alone.

**He:** You act like my mom sometimes.

**dk:** Well, she *did* tell me to look after you.

**He:** …Alright. I’ll wait.

**[EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE HIS BUILDING – NIGHT]**

The breeze had grown cooler, brushing over her skin like an afterthought. She walked slowly, head lowered, lips still tingling from the kiss she didn’t want to forget. But it wasn’t just that—it was the weight of his words, of everything he was too scared to believe in.

Her phone buzzed.

**naina:** Where are you? You’re not back yet?

**She:** I’m on my way. By the way, do we have any liquor in the room?

**naina:** Yeah, I brought a bottle today. We were about to start.

**She:** Don’t start without me. I need it more than all of you combined.

**naina:** Damn. What happened? Don’t tell me he dumped you.

**She:** No… but he was going to.

**naina:** Ugh, I told you. All guys are the same. They just want the body.

**She:** It’s not like that. Just… leave it. I’ll explain later. I’ll be there in five minutes.

**naina:** Alright, we’re waiting.

She ended the call but didn’t pick up her pace. Her mind was still back in that room, on that lap, on that promise. She wasn’t heartbroken—but she was rattled. Loving someone who expected loss more than love… it was like holding a match in the rain.

**\[INT. HIS APARTMENT – NIGHT\]**

The room looked like a battlefield of broken cravings—empty pizza boxes stacked like crooked monuments to laziness, a flickering bulb swinging gently, casting warped shadows across the peeling walls. A musty haze of alcohol, sweat, and the kind of silence that follows emotional storms clung to the air like humidity.

He was sprawled on the old couch like a body dumped there by fate, a half-finished bottle of whiskey cradled in one hand, his glass dangling between two fingers like a dying cigarette.

**DK** sat cross-legged on the dusty floor, a bottle of beer resting on his knee, head tilted like he was trying to solve a riddle. **Vir**, already a few shots deep, was lounging on a high stool near the broken window, grinning like a fox who’d found the henhouse.

**DK** (watching him down another swig):
“So you’re already halfway through that bottle, and still haven’t said a word. Spill it.”

**Vir** (snorts):
“He got dumped. Look at him—he’s got that dead-fish-on-a-frying-pan energy.”

**DK** (choking on laughter):
“Stop it! Don’t kill me while I’m drinking!”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he turned his face toward the window, staring at the moon as if it might blink back at him. A faint, helpless smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

**Vir** (nudging DK):
“Look at that. He’s smiling like an idiot. Nah, they didn’t break up.”

**DK** (squinting):
“Yeah… you're right. That’s not heartbreak. That’s the look of someone who just floated out of a dream.”

**Vir** (waving toward the snack bowl):
“Hey, Ariv, pass the chips before you start levitating.”

He tossed the bowl over lazily without turning.

**Ariv** (still looking out the window, voice quiet):
“Don’t bother me for a bit. Just... let me feel this for a while.”

**Vir** (grinning):
“Oh ho ho! I think I know exactly what's happening here.”

**DK**:
“Oh, please, enlighten us, O great love guru.”

**Vir** (bowing like a sage):
“Yes, my child. After deep meditation and two tequila shots, I have seen the truth—this man has achieved Nirvana.”

**DK** (eyes wide, playing along):
“Oooh, sensei! What is Nirvana?”

**Vir** (sipping solemnly):
“Nirvana, my child, is the sacred state achieved when two souls unite in physical cardio under the divine protection of a blanket.”

**DK**:
“Wait... isn’t that just sex?”

**Vir** (slamming his hand down dramatically):
“Blasphemy! How dare you reduce the sacred art of Nirvana to such crude words! You have insulted the temple!”

**DK** (panicking, laughing):
“I’m sorry, guruji! Forgive this foolish disciple!”

**Ariv** (finally turning, a tired smile on his lips):
“Can you both shut up for a second? And no, we didn’t do that.”

**Vir** (smirking):
“Of course you didn’t. No sane girl would let *you* do that.”

**DK** (losing it, bursting into laughter):
“He got you there, man.”

**Ariv** (smiling faintly, but there's a shadow under it):
“You know what’s wild? I finally found someone who makes me feel… calm.”

**DK** (slowing down a bit):
“Not excited. Not scared. Just still?”

**Ariv** (nods):
“Yeah.”

**Vir** (setting his drink down, suddenly more grounded):
“That’s rare, man. Most people never get that. So why do you look like you're bracing for an earthquake?”

**Ariv**:
“Because every time it felt like this before... it ended badly.”

**DK**:
“What do you mean?”

**Ariv** (glancing at the glass, then at them):
“My school crush ghosted me. Just vanished after a whole year of late-night calls.”

**Vir**:
“That was back in tenth, right? You were messed up for months.”

**DK**:
“And didn’t the long-distance one get married?”

**Ariv** (laughs without humor):
“Yeah. Arranged. She didn’t even tell me. I found out through her cousin’s Instagram story.”

**Vir** (grumbling):
“Damn. People suck.”

**DK**:
“And now this one?”

**Ariv** (pausing, then softly):
“She’s ready to fight fate just to stay with me. And I’m scared I’ll ruin her too.”

A moment of silence. Then:

**Vir** (softly):
“Maybe this time, don’t pull away. Maybe it’s not about avoiding the fall... maybe it’s about learning to land.”

**DK** (lifting his beer):
“To learning how to land.”

**Ariv** (clinking glasses):
“To not being a curse anymore.”

**Vir** (grinning):
“To Nirvana... someday.”

The dorm door loomed under the hallway’s flickering bulb, its chipped paint a dull gray in the shadows. She knocked once, her knuckles heavy with exhaustion, barely brushing the wood. The door creaked open, revealing Naina leaning against the frame, hair in a loose, messy bun, her sharp eyes scanning the latecomer with a guarded glint, lips pressed into a thin line.

“You’re late,” Naina said, voice low, stepping aside.

She shuffled inside, sneakers scuffing the worn floorboards, her gaze drifting to the cluttered table—two vodka bottles glinting like sentries, a torn packet of chips spilling crumbs, glasses half-filled with flat soda. The room was a dim, lived-in mess: one lamp glowed soft yellow, casting long shadows; an open window let in a chilly breeze, rustling empty chip packets on the floor. Simran sprawled cross-legged on the bed, phone glowing in her lap, her smirk already teasing.

“Hectic day, huh?” Simran said, tossing her phone onto a pillow, her voice light but prying, eyes glinting with mischief.

She toed off her sneakers with slow, laborious drags, each movement like shedding a layer of the day’s weight. Her fingers fumbled as she tugged off her top, letting it crumple by a rickety chair, and slipped into her old hoodie, the sleeve sliding off one shoulder, exposing a sliver of collarbone. She raked her hair into a messy bun, strands clinging to her sweat-damp neck, her movements sluggish, eyes distant.

“Yeah,” she muttered, voice rough, avoiding their stares. “The usual place.”

Simran leaned forward, elbows on her knees, smirk widening. “Usual place? What, did *he* chain you to the bed, or were you just too cozy to leave?” Her tone danced with playful accusation, testing the waters.

She reached for a vodka bottle on the floor, her fingers brushing its cold glass like an old, untrusted friend. She poured a straight shot, the liquid catching the lamplight, and downed it in one sharp gulp, the burn searing her throat. Her eyes glazed, staring at the empty glass, her shoulders slumping as if the drink had stolen her last spark.

“Swasti,” Naina said, voice firm but soft, cutting through the haze. She stepped closer, crouching slightly to meet her gaze. “Earth to Swasti. You okay?”

Swasti blinked, the name pulling her back, her lips twitching in a faint, tired grimace. She wiped her mouth with her sleeve, the fabric snagging on her chapped lips. “I’m tired, Simran,” she said, voice flat but edged, glancing at the bed. “Don’t poke me. Let me drink in peace.”

Naina perched on the table’s edge, crunching a chip, her gaze steady, like a cat watching a flickering shadow. “Drink all you want, Swasti. Pass out after. But first…” She tilted her head, a quiet challenge in her voice. “What happened?”

Simran swung her legs off the bed, sitting up, her eyes gleaming like a kid expecting a ghost story. “Yeah, spill! You’re drinking like you’re starring in a breakup playlist.”

Swasti sank to the floor, her back pressing against the bed’s creaky frame, legs sprawled out, the bottle resting beside her like a loaded gun. She poured another shot, hands trembling, the liquid sloshing slightly. She chugged it, the burn sharper, her throat tightening as she exhaled a shaky breath. “Not in the mood,” she said, voice low, fingers tracing the bottle’s peeling label, her knuckles white.

Simran clutched her own glass, blinking. “Straight vodka? No mix? Damn, Swasti, you’re going full rockstar tonight.”

“Drop it,” Swasti snapped, her voice slicing through the room, her eyes flashing briefly before dulling again. She leaned her head back against the bed, the wood creaking under her weight, her hoodie slipping further off her shoulder.

Naina crunched another chip, raising an eyebrow. “What’s with you acting like a drunk uncle at a family reunion?”

Swasti’s lips twitched, a ghost of a smirk, but it faded fast. “That’s the shit,” she muttered, almost to herself, her voice barely audible over the breeze rattling the window.

Simran took a tentative sip from her glass, wincing. “This burns like hell. What brand is this? You swapped the usual?”

Naina, munching, shrugged. “Swasti wanted something hard. This one’s heavier. Not our fruity crap.”

Simran’s eyes narrowed, darting to Swasti. “What kind of emotional apocalypse needs *this* level of booze?” She turned to Naina, mock-suspicious. “She told you something, right? Don’t play coy. What’s up? Why’s she drinking like her soul’s on vacation?”

Naina’s lips curved slightly, noncommittal. “Maybe… she got dumped?”

Simran’s eyes widened, her glass nearly tipping. “Ohhh, that explains the vodka funeral!”

Swasti didn’t look up, her fingers tightening around the bottle. “I’m not dumped,” she said, voice sharp, cutting through their banter. “You’re dumped.”

Simran grinned, undeterred, leaning back on her hands. “Sure, babe. Keep telling yourself that. He used you, ghosted you. Classic playboy move.”

Swasti’s jaw clenched, her free hand curling into a fist on her thigh. “Simran,” she said, voice low and dangerous. “Shut up.”

A tense silence fell, the breeze hissing through the window, chip packets crinkling faintly. Simran glanced at Naina, her grin softening into a conspiratorial smirk, and mouthed, “Wait for it.”

Naina took a slow sip, her eyes locked on Swasti, patient, calculating. “You should eat something, Swasti,” she said, voice calm but firm. “You’re drinking too fast.”

Simran nodded, swirling her glass. “Yeah, this ain’t juice. You’ll be out cold before we get any tea.”

Swasti poured another shot, her hands shakier now, the liquid splashing onto her fingers. She stared at it, eyes red-rimmed—not from tears, but from the weight of the day pressing down. “I don’t need anything,” she said, voice quieter, almost pleading. “Just… leave me alone for a bit.”

Simran fiddled with her glass’s edge, side-eyeing Swasti like she was deciphering a puzzle. “You’re too quiet, Swasti. It’s creepy. You’re usually spilling gossip by shot two.”

Swasti didn’t reply, her gaze fixed on the floor, shoulders slumped, the bottle’s shadow stretching across her lap. Not sad, not angry—just heavy, like gravity had doubled.

Naina leaned forward slightly, elbows on her knees. “She’s not talking like this,” she said to Simran, voice low. “Needs a push.”

Simran’s grin returned, sly. “Want me to slap her?”

Swasti’s head snapped up, her voice dry as bone. “I’ll yeet you off the balcony.”

Simran clutched her chest, mock-offended. “Wow, so violent! And here I was, ready to be your shoulder to cry on.”

Naina sipped her drink, unfazed. “Maybe emotional support’s the problem,” she said, her tone thoughtful, eyes still on Swasti.

Swasti exhaled, a sharp, frustrated huff. “Guys, I said drop it—”

Simran cut in, leaning forward, hands clasped like a talk-show host. “We will, we will. After you answer *one* question.”

Swasti leaned her head back against the bed, eyes closing, her bun loosening, strands falling across her face. “You two are like mosquitoes,” she muttered. “Buzzing till I swat you.”

Naina’s lips twitched, a rare smile. “Then swat us, Swasti. But spill something first.”

Simran’s eyes lit up, sensing a crack. “Easy one: Did you two fight?”

Swasti’s eyes stayed closed, her fingers loosening around the bottle. “No,” she said, voice soft, barely there.

Naina tilted her head, probing. “Then what? He say something weird? Flirt with someone else? You flirt with someone else?”

Simran jumped in, grinning. “Ooh, did you pull some jealousy stunt? Old-school drama?”

Swasti opened one eye, her expression flat. “God, no. That’s so… middle school.”

Simran pressed, undeterred. “Then what?”

Swasti hesitated, her thumb rubbing the bottle’s neck, her gaze flickering to the window where the moon hung, pale and sharp. “He said… something about his past,” she admitted, voice low, like the words were heavy to carry. “Stuff that’s… messed up.”

Naina’s brow furrowed, curious. “Like what? Family drama?”

Swasti shook her head, her hoodie sleeve slipping further, her fingers tightening briefly. “No.”

Simran leaned in, invested. “Ex-girlfriends? Spill, Swasti!”

Swasti’s lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes darting back to the bottle, then softening. “Yeah,” she said, quieter. “Three of them. All… left him. One ghosted. One ran away from home. One got married off.”

Simran’s jaw dropped, her glass clinking on the bed. “Three? Damn, he’s a walking soap opera!”

Naina sipped thoughtfully, her gaze steady. “Three’s not crazy. But sounds like he’s got baggage.”

Swasti nodded, her fingers tracing the floor’s cracks, her voice barely above a whisper. “He thinks… everyone who loves him leaves. Or gets taken.”

Simran picked up a chip, staring at it, her teasing gone. “That’s… heavy. Romantic, but fucked up.”

Naina’s eyes softened, just a fraction. “So what’d you say?”

Swasti’s lips curved, a small, defiant smirk breaking through her haze. “I kissed him,” she said, her voice steadier, a spark flickering in her eyes. She leaned back, the bed creaking, her fingers loosening around the bottle. “Twice.”

Simran choked on her chip, coughing, her eyes wide. “WHAT—”

Naina’s smile widened, rare and genuine. “And then?”

Swasti’s smirk grew, her gaze drifting, softer now. “He shut up.”

Simran laughed, loud and bright, nearly spilling her drink. “You shut him up with lips? Iconic move, Swasti!”

Naina pointed a chip at her, grinning. “Careful. You might’ve cursed him now.”

Simran flopped back on the bed, dramatic. “Or you’re his final boss. Three exes down, and the game throws in Swasti, the heartbreaker.”

Swasti’s smirk faded, her fingers brushing her lips, like she could still feel the kiss. “Maybe,” she murmured, her voice soft, almost wistful.

Simran sat up, suddenly serious, her voice lowering. “Wait. You didn’t sleep with him, right?”

Swasti’s eyes flicked to her, sharp. “No.”

Simran exhaled, relieved. “Good. Don’t when he’s all tragic. Guys get weird after that.”

Naina nodded, her tone gentle. “He’s not manipulating you, Swasti. Sounds… scared.”

Swasti’s shoulders relaxed, just a fraction, her gaze softening. “He’s not a bad guy,” she said, voice quiet but firm. “Just… tired. Like me.”

Simran stretched out on the floor, staring at the ceiling. “We’re all tired, babe.”

Swasti didn’t respond, her fingers still, the bottle forgotten. She shifted, turning toward the open window, her eyes catching the moon’s pale glow. It hung low, sharp against the night, its light spilling across her face, highlighting the shadows under her eyes, the faint curve of her lips. She stared at it, lost in its quiet pull, her breath steadying, like the moon was the only thing that understood her tonight.
