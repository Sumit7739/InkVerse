### **[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE – NIGHT]**

*The golden glow of a streetlamp spills over the quiet mountainside road. The faint hum of crickets blends with a cool breeze rustling the trees. Ariv approaches, his silhouette backlit by the warm store light. Nearby, two figures stand beside a bike, laughing softly, their voices floating on the wind.*

As Ariv reaches the edge of the lot, he pauses. His eyes drift upward—towards the distant lights of the girls’ dorms nestled on the hill. One window glows faintly. His gaze lingers, unreadable. Then he exhales, slips his hands into his pockets, and walks forward, wearing his most harmless smile.

**He walks up to them.**

*Ariv’s steps are unhurried, casual—but his eyes flicker with sharp focus. He taps one boy’s shoulder with gentle confidence.*

**STRANGER**  
Yes?

**ARIV**  
Hmm... I wanted to ask a favour.

*As Ariv sees the boy’s face fully under the light—he pauses.*

*His breath catches for half a second. Time seems to slow. The boy’s skin glows under the amber hue, long flowing hair shifting slightly in the breeze, eyes shimmering with an almost unreal clarity.*

**ARIV**  
Oh... it’s you. I’ve seen you a lot around here. Hmm… what was your name again?

*He squints slightly, tapping his finger on his chin, pretending to think—though part of him already knows.*

**STRANGER** *(smirking)*  
Do you remember, or should I tell you myself?

**ARIV** *(grinning playfully)*  
No, no… it’s coming to me. I’ve heard it a few times… It was something like... Aryan! Yes, Aryan. Am I right?

**ARYAN**  
Yes, you are. So, what favour do you want?

*Ariv takes a step back slightly, hands in his pockets, posture casual but his voice sincere.*

**ARIV**  
First... I want to ask you a question, if you don’t mind.

**ARYAN**  
Go on.

**ARIV**  
How are you so popular? Like, people always surround you. I mean, I can clearly see you're handsome—heck, even as a guy I can feel the charm.

*A small laugh escapes from the other boy standing nearby, his arms crossed, amused.*

**SAMEER**  
It's what you just said. He has this charm that pulls people in.

**ARIV** *(tilting his head in agreement)*  
Hmm, I can see that. Yeah, you're right. By the way, can I know your name?

**SAMEER**  
I’m Sameer. And you?

**ARIV**  
I’m Ariv.

*They shake hands. Sameer’s grip is firm—Ariv notices the strength in it.*

**ARIV**  
Well, there’s this guy in my dorm. He talks about you a lot.

**ARYAN** *(half-interested)*  
Oh? What does he say? Probably bad-mouthing me. Most of them do.

**ARIV**  
No, no. He’s actually a fan. Says things like you’re always surrounded by butterflies. Says he wants to be like you someday.

**ARYAN** *(chuckling, brushing a hand through his hair)*  
"Surrounded by butterflies"? That’s a new one.

**ARIV** *(smiling, amused)*  
Yeah, he’s like that. Says weird things out of nowhere.

*Aryan’s expression shifts—his smile fading into something distant. He glances away, eyes scanning the mountain skyline.*

**ARYAN** *(softly)*  
What’s the point of being surrounded by butterflies... if the one I want near me keeps flying to another, thinking it’s a flower, when it’s just a cactus?

*Ariv blinks, trying to register the weight of that line. A gust of wind rustles his hair.*

**ARIV** *(scratching his head)*  
Ohh… I don’t really get what you just said… but it sounds kinda deep.

*Sameer lets out a short scoff.*

**SAMEER**  
Ah, don’t think too much about it. He says random poetic stuff sometimes. Don’t mind him.

**ARIV** *(genuine smile, eyes soft)*  
Don’t worry, I don’t mind anything. I was just thinking about my own foolishness, not understanding the meaning. Still got a long way to go, I guess.

**ARYAN** *(shaking it off with a shrug)*  
Okay, back to the topic. What favour do you want? You want me to introduce you to some butterflies? You’ve got a decent face—maybe one or two might start revolving around you.

**SAMEER**  
Yeah, he’s right. You can come with us later.

**ARIV** *(waving it off, a little flustered)*  
Ah no, no. I already have someone. I don’t want other butterflies around me. I can’t even produce enough nectar for one—how can I handle more? I don’t have charm like you.

**ARYAN** *(smirking with mischief)*  
Ah, valid point. You do know where you stand.

**ARIV** *(nods with a half-smile)*  
Painfully, yes. I know that.

*He takes out a dead phone from his pocket, showing it briefly.*

**ARIV**  
So… what I wanted was, my phone's dead and I need to make a call. Can I borrow yours for a minute?

**ARYAN** *(turns to Sameer)*  
Sameer, give him your phone.

**SAMEER**  
Ah... my recharge ended today. Haven’t recharged yet.

**ARYAN**  
Okay, no problem. Here—take mine.

**ARIV**  
Ah, thank you very much.

*He quickly dials. His body shifts slightly as he talks, trying to stay polite yet urgent.*

**ARIV (on phone)**  
Hello? Hey, it’s me. My phone is dead—I’m calling from someone else’s.  
Yeah, I’m outside the convenience store.  
Okay, a cig pack… cold drink…  
Project details? My phone’s dead, I just told you. Okay wait, let me ask him.

**ARIV (to Aryan)**  
Bro, can I use your WhatsApp to get some project details?

**ARYAN** *(hesitates a beat, then nods once)*  
Hmm...

**ARIV**  
I need to get the required items from the store. He’ll send me the list. Can I ask him to send it to your number?

**ARYAN**  
Okay.

**ARIV**  
Thank you so much.

**ARIV (on phone)**  
Okay, send the file to this number.  
(to Aryan) Is this the WhatsApp number?

**ARYAN**  
Yeah.

**ARIV (on phone)**  
Yeah, send it on the same number. I’m waiting.

*A notification tone rings.*

**ARIV**  
Bro, can you unlock it?

**ARYAN**  
Sure. Pass is 0167.

**ARIV**  
Oh, okay.

*Sameer leans in, whispering with a grin.*

**SAMEER** *(under his breath)*  
I can’t believe *she* rejected you for this idiot.

**ARYAN** *(quietly, looking ahead)*  
Well… you can’t always have what you want.

*Meanwhile, Ariv stands a few feet away, reading the list aloud like a fool, completely unaware.*

**ARIV (reading)**  
Okay, I have to get… blue pen, black pen—five pieces each, masking tape, glitter pen…  
Wait, why do we need a glitter pen? Are we still in kindergarten?

**SAMEER**  
So… are you going to stop?

*Aryan watches Ariv’s innocent pacing, amused. A real smile forms on his lips.*

**SAMEER**  
I pity this guy now.

**ARIV (on phone)**  
Okay, I’ll come in ten minutes. Don’t start without me, wait for me, okay?  
(to Aryan) Thanks for your help. I’ll remember your kindness.

**ARYAN**  
No need. We should help each other in need.

**ARIV**  
Yes, yes. I really learned a lot from you. Most of your words went over my head, but I’ll try to understand them.

*Aryan laughs, light and honest, patting Ariv gently on the shoulder.*

**ARYAN**  
I’m liking you more and more now. Why don’t you hang out with us from now on? I’ll introduce you to others.

**ARIV** *(smiling awkwardly, almost shy)*  
Ah… how can I blend into your circle? You’re like a prince, and I’m just a lowly man.

**SAMEER**  
You don’t need to worry about that. We don’t mind these things.

**ARIV**  
I appreciate your proposal. I’ll think about it.

**ARYAN**  
No pressure. You can find me anytime you need something. You already know where to look, don’t you?

**ARIV (grinning)**  
Yeah. I’ll just look for the place where butterflies have gathered… and you’ll be in the middle.

**ARYAN (laughing genuinely)**  
Hahaha… I really like your humor.

**ARIV**  
Okay, I’m going. They’re waiting for me.

**ARYAN** *(nodding, voice soft)*  
Hmmm.

*Ariv turns and enters the store.*

**SAMEER**  
She really found herself a comedic character. Maybe she’s just with him to pass the time.

**ARYAN**  
Who knows. But I don’t think he could cause any problems for me later.

*Moments later, Ariv returns, holding two small bags. He hands Aryan two cigarette packs.*

**ARIV**  
Just a small gesture for your help. Maybe someday I can return it more appropriately.

*Aryan’s hand pauses briefly as he takes it. A strange flicker crosses his face—hard to read.*

**ARYAN**  
Oh, no need to fret over it.

**ARIV**  
Okay, bye. Let’s meet again, if fate allows.

*He walks away, this time not looking back. Aryan and Sameer remain standing as the wind picks up again.*

*Sameer lights Aryan’s cigarette. Smoke curls around his face.*

**SAMEER**  
What happened? You seem to be thinking something.

**ARYAN (exhaling smoke)**  
That last sentence made me feel a little uneasy—"returning appropriately."  
Maybe I’m overthinking it.

**SAMEER**  
I don’t think he’s capable of going against you.

**ARYAN**  
Let’s hope so.  
Or I won’t mind destroying him.

Aryan watches the silhouette fade into the misty road. A dog barks somewhere in the distance. The quiet feels heavier now.

### **[EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD – LATER]**

*Ariv walks alone down the winding mountain path, the moonlight tracing the edges of his figure. The cigarette pack in his hand crinkles faintly as he tightens his grip, then slides it into his pocket.*

*He pulls out his phone and powers it on. The screen flickers to life, casting a pale glow across his face.*

**ARIV**  
Acting really is hectic. I’ve got a new respect for actors now.

*He dials. The ringtone pulses softly in the still night.*

**ARIV**  
So, how’s everything there?

**VIR (on call)**  
Well… it worked.

**ARIV**  
Good. I’m on my way.

**VIR**  
Good job.

**ARIV**  
Same to—

*The line cuts. Ariv stares at the screen for a beat. Then he puts the phone away and keeps walking.*

**FADE TO BLACK.**
