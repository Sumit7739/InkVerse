**[INT. HIS ROOM — DAY]**

The room was dim, a lazy mess of half-finished thoughts and things left undone. Light filtered in through old curtains, dust catching in the sunbeams like static. Somewhere between boredom and habit, his phone began to ring.

He answered with a thumb swipe, already leaning back in his chair.

**He** (picking up): Hello?

**She** (direct, playful): Where are you?

**He**: Same old cave — the usual.

**She**: Try crawling out of that turtle shell you call a room, will you?

He let out a dry chuckle, rubbing a hand over his face.

**He**: You do realize a turtle can’t come out of its shell, right?

**She**: Idiot. Anyway, I’m coming over.

**He**: Why?

**She**: I just… wanted to see you.

**He**: And why would you want to do that?

**She**: I don’t know. Just felt like it.

There was a brief pause. He shifted in his chair, glanced toward the window, then back at the ceiling.

**He**: Huh. Where are you right now?

**She**: Near the convenience store.

**He**: Great. Grab me a pack of smokes.

**She**: Mhm. Anything else, your highness?

He glanced at the lighter on his desk, flicked it. No spark.

**He**: Yeah, my lighter’s dead. Get one of those too.

**She**: Noted.

**He**: And get something for yourself while you’re at it. My treat.

A beat.

**She** (mock-surprised): Oh wow, someone’s feeling generous today. What’s the occasion?

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he stared at the dust dancing in the light. His voice dropped, softer now.

**He**: You’ll know in a while.


**[INT. HIS ROOM — LATER]**

She opens the door.

He’s seated on a chair, a book in hand, glasses slipping slightly down his nose. Behind him, a cluttered desk — half chaos, half sanctuary — books stacked like a scholar’s wall, a laptop glowing quietly. A single chair faces him. Beyond it, a large window opens to the mountains. A bird's nest sways gently in the tree just outside. Peace lives here.

She walks in without knocking — like always — and tosses the cigarette pack and lighter onto the desk. It skitters slightly across the wood.

She settles into the chair across from him, her eyes briefly scanning the room like she’s checking for changes. None. She leans back, legs crossed.

Without a word, he gets up and walks into the kitchen, the soft creak of the floorboard following him.

**She** (calling out, half-curious, half-teasing): So… what’s the occasion?

**He** (from the kitchen, voice steady): Thinking of breaking up.

The air pauses.

She blinks, just once. The crease between her brows tightens, but only for a second.

**She** (casually): And… what brought that brilliant idea?

**He** (stirring coffee, metal spoon tapping the side of the cup): A cocktail of thoughts. But for simplicity’s sake… we just don’t work.

**She** (quietly): So you’re saying I’m not good for you?

He exhales, slow and shallow, leaning on the counter.

**He**: No, my lady. It’s the opposite. You’re the noble princess in a crystal tower, and I’m the guy milking sheep in the valley. Society wouldn’t root for this genre of love story.

She lets out a faint exhale through her nose. A smile ghosts across her lips but doesn’t stay.

**She**: I don’t care about society.

**He**: Well, I do. Society gives us jobs, money, overpriced WiFi, and bread. Unless, of course, you’re up for farming? I could teach you how to dig potatoes.

She rolls her eyes — a slow, tired motion.

**She**: Stop dodging and talk. What actually happened? Did someone say something?

**He** (still facing the counter): Someone did say something. *(pauses)* By the way — how much sugar? Still on that anti-sweetness diet?

**She**: No sugar. You’ve already made the day bitter enough.

His jaw twitches, but he nods and pours the coffee anyway.

**She**: So? What did this mysterious *someone* say?

**He**: They told me to look in the mirror.

**She**: And?

**He**: They said, *“She looks like milk and moonlight, like an angel on vacation from heaven. You, my friend, look like charcoal that lost the will to burn.”*

She bursts into laughter, hands pressed lightly to her mouth, eyes squinting shut.

**She**: That’s what made you spiral? Seriously?

He walks over and hands her the coffee. Their fingers don’t touch, but the space between them feels warmer for a moment.

**She** (still laughing, the sound fading): Okay fine, add some sugar now.

**He**: Nope. Drink it like this.

**She** (blinking, confused): Why?

**He** (softly): You’ll need it. Trust me.

She goes still. Her smile drops, not all at once — more like it forgets to hold on. The silence that follows isn’t empty. It’s dense. Weighty.

She looks at him. The coffee sits untouched in her hand, cooling by degrees.

---

Silence settles like fog.  
They sit across from each other, sipping coffee in an atmosphere thick with unspoken things. Their eyes meet now and then — brief, flickering contact. His gaze is measured, almost clinical; hers is softer, laced with confusion and something heavier underneath.

Two people in the same room, orbiting different thoughts.

**She** (grimacing): How the hell do you drink this bitter crap? It’s like my taste buds just signed a resignation letter.

**He** (smirking): Funny. You were chugging it like ancestral nectar just yesterday.

**She**: Exactly my point. What changed overnight?

He catches the weight in her tone. The smirk fades. He stirs his coffee slowly, the spoon clinking against the mug.

**He**: The heart… is fickle. It flips like a switch sometimes.

**She** (quietly, firmer): I didn’t think your heart was like that.  
Would you stop dodging already and just — be honest with me?

He looks up. His eyes are darker now, more direct.

**He**: How much do you even know me?

She hesitates, then lifts her chin slightly.

**She**: Not much. You never really shared anything.

**He** (raising an eyebrow): You never asked.

**She**: Oh, please. Then let me ask — how much do you know about me?

**He**: Almost everything.

She blinks. He goes on, voice casual but with an edge beneath the words.

**He**: Your childhood stories, your extended family tree, the mole on your back you think no one noticed… Your love for mangoes but hate for mango-flavored anything. The way your voice dips when you’re sad and lifts just a little when you’re faking a smile.  
I’ve paid attention.

She looks at him — really looks. Disbelief and realization wrestle behind her eyes.

**She** (softly): Then… what’s the problem?

**He** (locked on her): I don’t know.  
Maybe that’s the problem — I never *felt* anything from you. Not truly.

She looks down. That one lands.

**She** (whispers): Then why were we even in this… for a year?

He leans back, mug in hand, staring into the last bit of his coffee.

**He**: Because I thought maybe… you understood me.  
Better than anyone else did. You read between the lines. You knew what I was thinking without me saying it.  
Maybe that’s why I stayed.  
Wishful thinking, probably.

He sets the mug down gently.

**He** (continuing): But it felt like I was holding on to something that wasn’t real. A mirage. And I don’t want to drag you into a one-sided story.  
You deserve more than that.

She doesn’t respond. Just finishes the last sip of her coffee, the bitterness now blending into the quiet around her.

She turns to the window — where the mountains loom like silent witnesses and the little bird’s nest sways gently in the breeze.

He watches her. Studies her.  
Trying to decode the silence in her posture — the curve of her brow, the twitch in her lip, the grip on the mug.

She smirks. Leans in slightly.

**She** (teasing): So... have you ever felt it before? You know — that stupid little thing called love?

He raises an eyebrow. Doesn’t smile.

**He**: Yeah. I did. Once.

She straightens a bit, eyes narrowing — not with suspicion, but curiosity.

**She**: Oh? Do tell.  
You never really shared stuff like that with me. I always figured you’d get awkward if I pried too much into your past.

**He**: You had full permission to pry. You still do.  
I would've told you anything, everything — gladly.  
But you never asked.

*(pauses, a small smile flickering and fading)*  
I appreciate that, by the way.  
The way you respected my space.  
But maybe... that’s part of the reason we’re sitting here like this now.

She rolls her eyes, half-amused.

**She**: You’re acting like a kid now.

He leans back, arms behind his head.

**He**: I *am* a kid in an adult’s body. My heart still has that childlike innocence.

**She** (sarcastically): Oh yeah? That “innocence” — where was it when you made that girl’s life hell?  
Turned her into a social outcast? Gave her enough trauma to leave the university?

He chuckles. Darkly.

**He**: Damn, you’re really something.

*(pauses)*  
As for her... I can’t stand people who try to defame you.  
The kid in my heart told me to ruin her — and then promptly went on vacation.

She shakes her head, smirking despite herself.

**She**: Psychopath with morals.  
*(leans in again)*  
Alright then, Romeo — tell me about this sweetheart of yours.

---

He takes a deep breath, voice softening, the memory pulling at him.

**He**: It was during school. There was this girl in my class.  
I was painfully shy back then — barely looked people in the eye.

*(pauses)*  
She lived a block away. Sometimes we’d bump into each other on the walk to school. I never had the guts to talk to her first. But… I think she noticed.

*(half-smiles)*  
She started things — casual, harmless. Eventually, she’d hold my hand during those walks. And I’d just… follow.  
Eyes on the ground, heartbeat in my throat.

His tone turns dreamy for a second, like the memory is coloring the room.

**He**: I swear, whenever she was around, the world would blur.  
Like someone turned off the background noise — and it was just her.

**She** (cutting in, eyebrow raised):  
You *do* realize you’re talking about another girl in front of your current girlfriend?  
And you're way too happy reminiscing about it.

He snaps out of it, blinking. A little flustered now.

**He**: What I meant was… I never felt that way again. Not until—

*(pauses)*  
Well. During our farewell, she asked me, “Do you like me?”  
I nodded like a dumbass.  
She just smiled and said, “Yeah… I figured.”

That was it. No confession. No drama.  
We both walked away. Never spoke again.

She crosses her arms, eyes narrowing.

**She**: So… if you liked her that much, why didn’t you go after her?

**He** (shrugging):  
I lacked the courage.  
What if she’d said no? That *what if* was enough to stop me.

**She**: You — not going after something you wanted? That’s… new.

**He** (softly):  
Yeah. I was like that. Quiet.  
College changed that. I started shaping my character.  
Became... this version of me.

**She** (smirking):  
Hard to believe you were that guy — all timid and unsure. What a reveal.

**He** (groaning):  
Don’t make fun of me.

**She** (throwing her hands up, innocent):  
I’m not! I’m *understanding*.

*(grinning hard now)*

**He** (narrowing his eyes):  
Your face says otherwise.

She *tries* to hold a straight face. Fails completely.

**She**: Okay, okay — sorry! I couldn’t help it.

He stands, grabs both mugs, heads to the kitchen.

**She** (calling after him):  
Don’t be mad!

**He** (from kitchen):  
I’m not mad.

He comes back, brushing his hands on his jeans, settles again.  
She watches him, playful — but something searching behind the grin.

**She**: So…  
*(squints dramatically)*  
Do you still remember her? Or planning to elope?

He meets her gaze. Calm. Unreadable.

She watches the silence stretch. Then—

**She** (sharper):  
What, you had a change of heart?  
You gonna chase her again and just… shift me out of the way?

**He** (exhaling):  
It’s not like that.  
It’s been over ten years.  
She’s a ghost from a life I buried. I don’t want anything from her.

**She**:  
Then *why the fuck* do you want to break up?

*(beat)*  
Tell me. And don’t give me that “you don’t know me” crap.  
That’s bullshit.

*(leans forward)*  
I didn’t want to rush things.  
We still have a year before graduation — and a whole life beyond that.  
I thought I’d get to know you… slowly. When *you* were ready.

He stares at her. Something tight in his expression.  
Silence stretches.

**He** (quietly):  
So you really want to know?

**She** (voice dropping):  
Yes.  
Tell me honestly.

*(beat)*  
Wait…

*(squints, mock suspicious)*  
Are you… impotent?  
Is that why you’ve never tried anything with me? Hmm?

A beat. He blinks.

**He** (deadpan):  
Wow. Straight to the point, huh?

**She** (arms crossed, smirk twitching):  
I mean — I’m a thorough woman.

**He** (rubbing his temples):  
No. I’m not impotent.  
If anything, I’m… over-functional.

*(deadpan)*  
I just don’t want to be intimate with someone I’m unsure about.

**She** (soft now):  
Unsure about *me*?

**He**:  
No.  
Unsure about *myself*.  
What I feel. What I want.  
What I need.

*(beat)*  
If I’m being honest, I think I’ve always been a little broken.  
Like I wasn’t built for love — just… observation. Strategy. Distance.

*(softly)*  
I tried with you because you saw through the fog a little.  
But somewhere deep down, I knew I’d hurt you.

**She**:  
Okay wait—  
If you want me to *really* know you, then tell me—

Did you have any other relationships?  
After her?

**He** (groaning):  
Here we go…

**He**:  
Yes. Two.

**She** (narrowing eyes):  
Two??

*(gasps)*  
So you *were* a playboy!  
Playing with girls’ feelings — tossing them aside!

**He** (wounded-laugh):  
Hey! That’s harsh.

**She** (dramatic):  
Then what’s happening *right now*?

*(leans closer)*  
How long did those last?

**He**:  
A year. Maybe more.

**She** (hands to forehead):  
I *knew* it!

*(mock-faints)*  
Use-and-throw. Textbook.  
God, what did I see in you?  
Ugh — someone kill me.  
Wait — *no*. Don’t kill me.  
Beat him. Beat this playboy right here!

**He** (alarmed, laughing):  
Would you calm down?!  
You sound like a crime show monologue.

**She** (pointing at invisible jury):  
Save me from this pervert!  
Wait…

*(blinks)*  
You never even touched me like that…

**He** (arms crossed):  
Are you done?

**She** (grinning):  
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.  
Went a little overboard.

**He**:  
A little?

**She**:  
I didn’t *mean* it like that…

**He**:  
Oh? Then how *did* you mean it?

**She** (laughing, waving):  
Don’t say it again!  
Fine. Go on. Tell me about your past *romance*.

**He** (quiet):  
It wasn’t romance.  
It was… tragedy.

**She** (eyes wide):  
Oh god. Tragedy?  
Wait—  
Did you get them pregnant or something?

**He** (dead stare)

**She** (hands up):  
Okay okay! I’ll shut up.

*(zips lips)*  
Go on, you pervert playboy.

**He**:  
That’s it.

He glares. She bursts out laughing.

**He**:  
Do you want to hear it or not?

**She**:  
Okay okay okay!

*(mock zips lips again)*  
Mmm-hmm. I’m listening.
