### **INT. LIVING ROOM – MORNING**

*Fade in from black.*

A soft hum of wind weaves through an open window. The room glows with the golden hue of late morning — sunlight slicing through dusty air, settling over the quiet chaos of a lived-in space.

It’s Sunday.

The sun is high in the sky, casting warmth over a sleeping world. Inside, Vir, Ariv, and DK lie sprawled across couches and mattresses like fallen warriors after a long battle. Blankets tangled. Limbs stretched in dramatic disarray. They sleep like corpses — peaceful, heavy, unaware.

**CLACK.**  
A gust of wind slams the window shut.

The sharp sound echoes through the silence.

Vir stirs.

He groans softly, eyes fluttering open. Blinking against the light, he turns to the wall clock — 11:30.

A sigh escapes him.

He sits up slowly. His hair’s a mess, eyes puffy — a face that tells stories of last night’s chaos.

His gaze shifts to the battlefield of brothers.

A spark flickers behind his eyes. A smirk blooms.

He carefully lifts DK’s hand and drapes it over his own shoulder.  
Then shifts DK’s leg over Ariv’s back.  
Finally, he lifts the half-sleeping Ariv and drops him onto DK’s lap.

A tableau of pure scandal.

Vir steps back — a sculptor admiring his masterpiece.  
**Click.**  
He snaps a photo.

The grin doesn’t leave his face.

### **INT. BATHROOM – CONTINUOUS**

Vir stands at the sink, hands gripping the edge, staring into the mirror.

Dark circles under his eyes — not dramatic, but enough.

He studies himself like he’s trying to remember the person looking back.

The wind whispers again through the open window. His fingers twitch.

He turns on the tap.  
Splashes water over his face.  
Like washing off a mask.  
Or clearing a slate.

### **INT. LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS**

The place is unusually tidy.

No bottles. No wrappers. Just… stillness.

Vir walks to the table and sits. He picks a cigarette from a crumpled pack, lights it with a flick.

**Drag.**  
**Exhale.**

His eyes drift toward the window.

**Wide shot**: A view of the mountains. Trees swaying. A bird’s nest perched just outside the frame. Tiny hatchlings chirp. The mother bird returns, dropping food into waiting beaks.

Vir watches, flicking ash gently into the tray.  
There’s a quiet sadness in his gaze.

The laptop screen glows faintly beside him.  
He types something. Checks something else.  
Then just… stares.

---

Ariv stirs behind him.

Already awake.

Watching Vir in silence — calm, amused. Like he’s watching someone else’s film.

**ARIV (softly)**  
You look quite sophisticated right now.

Vir flinches, turning. He hadn’t noticed anyone else was up.

**ARIV**  
No need to feel shy. We’re both men here.

He glances at DK — limbs still flopped over in suggestive positions.

**ARIV (grinning)**  
…Though I’m not so sure about him.

He yawns. Stretches. Reaches for his phone.

A beat.  
Then panic.

**30+ messages. 10+ missed calls. All from Swasti.**

**ARIV (under breath)**  
Shit.

He scrolls.  
Face morphing like a TikTok filter: panic, regret, confusion, dread.

Vir chuckles from the table.

**VIR (teasing)**  
Ah… young love.

Ariv bolts toward the bathroom.  
Vir, finishing his smoke, approaches the bed.

His shadow looms over DK.

A slow, evil grin crawls across his face.

**VIR (mock whisper)**  
Acting all high and mighty last night, huh? Let’s see… what should I do with you?

Ariv exits the bathroom mid-step — and freezes.

The scene looks like a setup from a horror movie.

**ARIV (whispers)**  
Yeah... DK is definitely fucked. He teased him a lot yesterday.

Vir glances over.

**ARIV (hands raised)**  
Hey, I didn’t see anything. Carry on.

Vir’s grin turns… unsettling.

Ariv backs away, grabs a cigarette, and perches on a chair like a neutral observer.

Then —  
**Vir plunges his hand under the mattress.**

**FLIP.**  
DK’s limp body turns midair like a pancake.

**DK (half-screaming)**  
WHO THE FUCK DID THAT?!

He sees Vir. Then Ariv.

Ariv shrugs, gesturing — *“I warned you.”*

**DK**  
Hey, hey! We can talk this out! No need for violen—

**WHAP.**  
A pillow slams into his face.

**DK (muffled)**  
Ahh! Stop! Not the face, man!

Ariv bursts out laughing — full, unfiltered amusement.

**DK**  
Why are you laughing?! Help me, damn it!

Vir turns to Ariv.

**ARIV (deadpan)**  
I’m not moving. You’re on your own.

Vir finally stops.

DK breathes — maybe it’s over.

**DK**  
Thank God... what is wrong with you? Senile already? Hitting me first thing in the morni—

**VIR (calm, commanding)**  
Get up and do the dishes.

**DK (blinking)**  
…Huh?

**VIR (louder)**  
Did you hear me or not? Or should I *really* get serious?

DK gets up like a schoolboy called to detention.

Grumbling. Groaning. But moving.

He drags his feet toward the kitchen.

**Vir exhales**.  
Long. Deep. Satisfying.

He walks back to the window.  
Birds still chirping. Wind still whispering.  
The world carrying on like nothing happened.

### **INT. LIVING ROOM – LATER THAT AFTERNOON**

The sun has shifted, casting a warm, golden light that filters through the worn-out curtains, painting soft, intricate patterns on the floor. Dust drifts lazily through the air, suspended like snowflakes caught in a moment. The room is calm now, the storm of the morning settling into quiet stillness. Only the distant chirps of birds and the hum of the ceiling fan break the silence.

Ariv is hunched over the laptop at the dining table, a soft frown creasing his forehead. The light from the screen reflects off his glasses as he scrolls slowly, fingers pausing every so often, as if weighing the importance of each line. Vir sits cross-legged on the floor across from him, clutching a pillow like armor, his posture slouched, eyes half-lidded from lack of sleep. Dark circles accentuate the hollows beneath his eyes, making them even more prominent in the soft sunlight. DK paces restlessly, sipping something warm from a chipped mug, occasionally peeking over Ariv’s shoulder to annoy him.

**Ariv** *(without looking up)*:  
So… have you reviewed it yet?

**Vir** *(rubbing his eye, his voice rough from sleep)*:  
No. There's still a chunk missing. But I’m going to sort what we do have—piece by piece.

**DK** *(flopping dramatically onto the couch, one arm thrown over his forehead)*:  
What did you expect? Rome wasn’t burned in one night.

**Vir** *(raising an eyebrow)*:  
You mean "built"?

**DK** *(pointing lazily at him, dead serious)*:  
Nah. I meant what I said.

Ariv snorts, a quiet laugh escaping before he catches himself. He leans back slightly, stretching, a few soft cracks from his spine. His gaze drifts to the window—the sky outside is soft blue, clouds moving slowly, as if in no rush to be anywhere.

**Ariv** *(calmly)*:  
No need to rush. I still have some time left.

His voice trails off like a drifting thought. Vir and DK pause, exchanging a brief glance before silently nodding in agreement.

**Vir** *(dryly)*:  
Mhm. Time... the one luxury we never had, but somehow always abuse.

**DK** *(leaning forward, squinting in suspicion)*:  
Hey, one thing’s bugging me—how the hell did you get access to the college server? I’ve tried cracking it before and failed.

Ariv looks up, a sly, amused smile playing on his lips, his eyes glinting with that signature edge of mockery.

**DK** *(frowning)*:  
Don’t smile. Your teeth look yellow.

**Ariv** *(smirking)*:  
Just say you're jealous.

**DK** *(defensive)*:  
I’m not.

**Ariv** *(tilting his head with mock sincerity)*:  
It’s a long story. I’ll tell you some other day.

**DK** *(groaning dramatically, throwing his head back)*:  
You see that? Now he’s hiding things from us.

**Vir** *(nodding along, equally dramatic)*:  
Tragic. We’ve lost him to the dark side.

**Ariv** *(grinning)*:  
I’m not hiding anything. I’m just... not in the mood.

**Vir** *(leaning forward, his gaze sharpening slightly as he watches Ariv)*:  
So... how was he?

Ariv hesitates for a moment, his smile faltering just slightly. He looks down, as though measuring the weight of his words.

**Ariv** *(softly)*:  
More than what he shows.

Vir’s expression tightens, a brief flicker of something unreadable crossing his face.

**Vir** *(eyes narrowing slightly)*:  
Hmm. It’ll be difficult then.

**Ariv** *(quietly, a flicker of resolve crossing his face)*:  
Yeah. Difficult, but not impossible.

Vir studies him for a beat longer, as if searching for something unsaid, something deeper in the way Ariv holds himself.

**Vir**:  
You used to say that before, too... So, are you sure about her?

DK, who had been aimlessly stirring his drink with his finger, freezes for a moment, curiosity piqued.

**Ariv** *(leaning back in the chair, looking up at the ceiling, his tone faraway)*:  
Back then, I was just a spectator. I watched as they were snatched away, right in front of me. And I did nothing.

**DK** *(surprisingly serious, without sarcasm)*:  
What could you have even done? Fight their parents? Beg them not to marry her off?

Ariv turns to DK, his eyes sharp, a glint of humor mixed with something darker. He tilts his head, as though pondering the question before answering.

**Ariv**:  
Yeah. I thought about that yesterday... Maybe cry while begging. It’d be more effective that way.

DK bursts into laughter, the tension lifting. Vir chuckles, reaching out to gently pat Ariv’s head.

**Vir** *(mock warning)*:  
You should keep your distance from him. His influence is clearly spreading.

**DK** *(feigning offense)*:  
Hey, what do you mean by that?

The room fills with the easy warmth of laughter. The tension cracks like ice, leaving behind a soft, relaxed atmosphere. Vir picks up the cigarette pack from the table—only two left—and lights one, silently offering the other to Ariv, who accepts with a nod.

The flame from the lighter flickers against Ariv's face as he takes a drag. His eyes narrow slightly as he inhales, the moment stretching, the world outside seeming to slow down. A few quiet moments pass as the three of them sit in comfortable silence—worn out, stretched thin, but still here.

Ariv exhales the smoke slowly, his gaze drifting toward the window.

**Ariv** *(calm, unwavering)*:  
I’ve made up my mind. This time... I’ll write my own fate. Let’s see who has the power to snatch her away from me.

Vir and DK both look at him. For a long moment, there’s no smirking, no teasing. Just a quiet pride—maybe even a bit of awe—as they watch him. There’s a shift in the air, a soft acknowledgment of something more than just their usual antics.

They smile, but it’s different this time. A genuine understanding.
