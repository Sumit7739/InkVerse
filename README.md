# InkVerse ✒️🌌  

A place where I throw words into the void and hope someone reads them.  

## What is this?  
InkVerse is where my novels live, probably regretting their existence.  
If you like stories, congrats—you have good taste. If you don’t, well... you’re missing out.  

## Why?  
Because writing is cheaper than therapy.  
Because imaginary worlds need a place to breathe.  
Because, frankly, someone has to do it.  

## How to Use?  
1. Open the platform.  
2. Read.  
3. Pretend you were emotionally moved.
