**He**, *half-smiling despite himself, starts gathering his thoughts, eyes drifting into the distance.*

**He** *(softly)*:  
"So, it was when I was in 9th. One day I just didn’t feel like going to school... so I went to the railway station instead."

**She** *raises an eyebrow, her lips curling up in amusement. There’s a spark in her eyes now, not just at the absurdity, but at the idea of him—usually so composed—being a rebellious 14-year-old.*  

**She** *(teasing)*:  
"Wait, wait. You... bunked school, packed a bag, and took a solo train adventure to see how electricity is made? At 14? Wasn’t that... risky?"

**He** *grins, a chuckle escaping him. But his eyes don’t quite meet hers—they’re fixed somewhere else, still seeing the version of him from back then.*

**He**:  
"I always wanted to visit NTPC — you know, the power plant? I don’t know why, it just fascinated me. So, I bought a ticket, changed into a different outfit I packed, and hopped on the train. I had two hours, and around seven hours before school ended. It felt perfect."

**She** *laughs slightly, shaking her head. She’s clearly amused, but there’s a sliver of concern in her tone too—like she can’t decide whether to admire him or scold him.*

**She**:  
"Still sounds wild to me. I mean, that's not exactly the kind of thing most teenagers do on a whim."

**He** *shrugs, still half-lost in the memory.*

**He**:  
"Well, I didn’t get kidnapped, so I guess I’m still here to tell the story."  

**She** *softens at that—her laughter fading into something warmer, more affectionate. She watches him a little longer, now seeing the boy behind the story.*

**She** *(quietly)*:  
"Go on."

**He** *exhales, leaning back slightly as he lets the memory settle in. His tone drops a little as he recalls the next part.*

**He**:  
"Everything was fine until I reached my destination. Or, well... I *thought* I had. But I didn’t realize the train had arrived. So, I sat there, like an idiot, watching everyone else get off. And the train — being an express — didn’t stop again for a long time. By the time I figured it out, I was too late."

**She** *leans in, her amusement giving way to genuine concern. Her gaze sharpens, not judging—just trying to understand the boy who made this bold, and slightly foolish, choice.*

**She**:  
"Oh my god. How did you not realize? How could you mess that up? You're usually so careful."

**He** *chuckles, a bit of self-deprecating humor lacing his words. His tone is light, but there’s an edge of embarrassment lingering underneath.*

**He**:  
"Well, in that moment, I wasn’t exactly the most... calculated. Panic hit me hard. People were asking me questions, and I just stared at them like I didn’t even know where I was anymore."

**She** *(half-worried, half-curious)*:  
"That’s terrifying. What did you do?"

**He** *pauses for a beat, his smile fading just a little, eyes darkening as he remembers the panic of the moment.*

**He**:  
"I just froze. Total blank. It was like everything I thought I knew — all the planning — went straight out the window. And school was already over, and I was still on that train."

*There’s a quiet silence between them. The weight of the story seems to settle over the room, heavier than before. She watches him closely, her earlier amusement now replaced with empathy, even admiration.*

**She** *(after a pause)*:  
"That... that sounds horrible."

**He** *gives her a tight smile, but his eyes betray the memory's impact.*

**He**:  
"I panicked. But then... this old man sitting next to me noticed. He was calm, like nothing was wrong. He asked about my family and, weirdly enough, knew my dad when I mentioned his name. He told me to call home."

**She** *blinks, processing what he’s said. Her brow furrows, her voice quieter now.*

**She**:  
"So, your dad... was calm about it?"

**He** *nods, a slight smirk tugging at his lips.*

**He**:  
"Yeah. The moment I called him, he just... sighed, and said, ‘Hmm, I see... well, you reap what you sow. Okay, here, talk to your mother.’ My dad was so zen about the whole thing. My mom, on the other hand... well, she wasn’t."

**She** *chuckles softly, though her expression still holds that trace of concern. The kind you give when a story is both absurd and somehow endearing.*

**She**:  
"That’s... wild. But how did they help you?"

**He**:  
"Dad didn’t freak out. He just told me, ‘Don’t worry. When you get to the final station, find a TT or the police. Or call me, and I’ll handle it. I’ll catch the next train to come get you.’"

**She** *smiles faintly, clearly impressed now—not just with the story, but with how his family handled it.*

**She**:  
"That’s... surprisingly calm for your dad. And your mom? Was she as calm?"

**He** *laughs, the sound rich with fondness and a touch of nostalgia.*

**He**:  
"No. My mom went full emotional rollercoaster. Cried, yelled, and then I jokingly told her, ‘Hey, this might be our last call, so record it just in case you miss me.’"

**She** *chuckles, shaking her head, clearly picturing the chaos.*

**She**:  
"God, you really had your hands full. But... what happened after that?"

**He**:  
"Long story short, the old man took the phone, spoke with my dad for a bit, and then gave it back. A while later, my dad called again and told me to go with the old man. The Old man worked at the nearby place and My Father knew someone in charge there. My dad had already made arrangements. The man would take me in for the night and bring me back the next day. I just had to call every hour to check in."

**She** *watches him, her eyes wide, clearly soaking in the layers. Her voice comes out softer this time, more moved than amused.*

**She**:  
"That’s... crazy. But... kind of sweet. You ended up in good hands."

**He** *nods, a faint smile on his lips, but there's a quiet sadness underneath it.*

**He**:  
"Yeah. I was fine, safe, and came back the next day. But... I always remember the feeling of being completely lost. Like I had no control over what was happening."

**She** *(softly, almost whispering)*:  
"That’s... a lot for a 14-year-old. But I get why you don’t share it. It’s one of those memories you probably don’t want to relive."

**He** *nods slowly, then leans forward, looking at her more seriously. His voice shifts again—something lighter returning to it, but it carries a twist.*

**He**:  
"Yeah... and the romance part? That came later."

**She** *raises an eyebrow, playfully now, though her interest is piqued in a different way.*

**She**:  
"Wait, romance? From the train station debacle?"

**He**:  
"It wasn’t like that at first. The old man had a granddaughter visiting. At first, she kept her distance, but... over time, we started talking. She showed me around, and we ended up spending hours just talking."

**She** *leans in slightly, curiosity dancing in her eyes.*

**She**:  
"And?"

**He** *(with a faint, bittersweet smile)*:  
"That night, we ended up sharing the same bed. Nothing serious, but there was a connection there. She was a year older, but we just clicked."

**She**:  
"So, you guys stayed in touch?"

**He** *nods, his smile fading as he remembers the next part.*

**He**:  
"Yeah. We’d talk every night, and she even proposed to me after a while. It was... simple, pure. A long-distance thing, but it meant something."

**She** *watches him, her voice now quieter, more careful, as if afraid to disturb the fragility of that memory.*

**She**:  
"But... what happened?"

**He** *exhales, the weight of the memory heavy on his chest. His words come slower now, as if each one costs him something.*

**He**:  
"Things changed. Slowly. The calls started dropping off. From every day, to once in a while, to nothing at all. I tried calling her, but she wouldn’t pick up. Then, right before my board exams, she called again... and told me we couldn’t talk anymore. She was getting married."

**She** *sits back slightly, her eyes wide, disbelief blooming across her face. Her breath catches just a little.*

**She**:  
"What...?"

**He** *stares at the floor for a long moment, his voice low, almost detached now.*

**He**:  
"It hit me hard. I didn’t know how to react. I just... couldn’t process it. And then I gave my exams. Scored well. But it all felt pointless."

*She doesn’t say anything right away. The silence is heavy, but not awkward. It’s filled with something unspoken—respect, sorrow, understanding. Then, slowly, her voice breaks through it.*

**She** *(softly)*:  
"That’s... tragic. I’m sorry."

---

She stays quiet for a beat, her fingers absentmindedly twirling a loose strand of hair. Then she glances up at him, eyes softer now.  
**She:**  
“So... she just left like that? No fight, no warning?”

He lets out a dry chuckle, but there’s no humor in it. He leans back against the wall, tilts his head to look at the sky.  
**He:**  
“Yeah. Just one call and boom. Gone.”  
*A pause. He exhales, slowly.*  
“I mean... I get it. Maybe she had her reasons. Pressure, family, whatever. Still felt like shit though.”

She nods slowly, her gaze dropping to her lap.  
**She:**  
“Must’ve been... hard.”  
*Then, with a slight smirk tugging at the edge of her lips—*  
“And here I thought I was the queen of teenage heartbreak. Guess you snatched the crown.”

She shifts closer, her tone softening.  
**She:**  
“Tell me more. About your past. I want to know the person I love.”

He stiffens just a little at her words—didn’t see that one coming. For a moment, his eyes search hers, like he’s trying to figure out if she meant it.  
**He:**  
“What’s the point? We’ll both go our own ways eventually... or are you planning to gather ammo to blackmail me later?”

**She:**  
“Who knows? But one thing’s for sure—I'm not going anywhere. We’ll walk the same path.”

He looks at her for a long moment, something unspoken flickering behind his eyes. Then he picks up his cigarette pack, taps one out with practiced fingers, and lights it. The first drag hangs in the air between them.  
**He (half-smiling):**  
“Let’s see how long you hold onto that.”

And with that, he pushes himself up and walks toward the balcony, smoke trailing behind him.

She watches him go, then scoffs under her breath.  
**She:**  
“Where the hell are you going now, Shakespeare?”

**He (without turning):**  
“Thought it’d look cool if I ended the line and walked away dramatically.”

**She:**  
“Cool my ass.”  
*She gets up and follows him, poking his side with two fingers.*  
“Sit down and explain what that cryptic crap meant. And don’t try me, or I’ll beat you so bad you’ll cry in Morse code.”

He turns to look at her, caught between amusement and disbelief, lips curling into a crooked grin.  
**He:**  
“You’re insane.”

**She:**  
“You’re welcome.”

*She folds her arms, watching him with a tilted head, like trying to read between the lines.*

**She:**  
“So tell me… do you still miss her? Or is it just... some leftover feeling messing with your head?”

He lets out a soft breath—not quite a sigh, just enough to fog up the silence. He leans forward, elbows on knees, staring down at his fingers like they might spell the answer out for him.  
**He:**  
“No. It’s not that. I don’t feel anything for her anymore. Or the school crush either. That chapter’s done.”  
*He pauses, picking at the edge of his thumbnail, then glances up at her.*  
“The part that messes with me... is how easily I forgot them. Like they were just… placeholders in time. Blips. Nothing.”

She studies him quietly, noticing the way his shoulders slope just slightly when he says that. It clicks for her—what he’s really saying. That it’s not about them at all. It’s about him. The way he detaches. The way things slip through his hands and leave barely a mark.

**She:**  
“Do you regret that?”

He leans back, arms spread across the back of the couch, eyes drifting up to the ceiling like the answers might be carved there.  
**He:**  
“I don’t know. I mean... I’m genuinely happy for them. I hope they’re doing well, living good lives. But the weird part? I can’t even remember their faces. Or their voices. It’s like... they were dreams I forgot right after waking up.”

She doesn’t speak right away. She sits beside him, tracing the lines on her palm, like she’s looking for something there too. Then:  
**She (softly):**  
“Maybe that’s your way of surviving. Like your mind files things away when they stop mattering. Even if your heart doesn’t agree.”

He doesn’t reply, just nods a little, eyes still far off. She reaches out and gently tugs on his sleeve.

**She:**  
“But I hope... I’m not that easy to forget.”

That brings his eyes back to her. Slowly. Like he’s coming out of a tunnel.

**He:**  
“You won’t be. Even if I wanted to. You’re the part that doesn’t feel like a dream.”

She breaks eye contact, biting back a smile that almost slips through.

**She:**  
“Good. ’Cause if you ever forget me, I’ll haunt you like a ghost.”

He chuckles under his breath.

**He:**  
“That sounds about right.”

---

**She:**  
“So tell me about the second one. Or just… tell me more about your past. I want to understand what made you think the way you do now.”

He leans back a little, smirking.  
**He:**  
“Well then, time for a flashback...”  
*He raises an imaginary curtain with his hands.*  
“So, this was around 12th grade. There was this girl in my college. Lively, charming—”

She cuts in immediately, raising an eyebrow.  
**She:**  
“Why do you always start like that? ‘Charming,’ really? You never call *me* charming. I get none of this praise.”

He grins, putting a hand to his chest mockingly.  
**He:**  
“Ah, forgive me, mylady. I shall rephrase for your royal standards.”

She leans back, arms crossed but amused.  
**She:**  
“Hmm. I hope so.”

**He:**  
“So, during college, there was this girl. Not charming, not lively—just... existing. But somehow, she caught my attention. Even then, I kept my distance.”  
*He glances over at her for effect.*  
“She was friends with this other girl—technically my cousin, but the connection was buried somewhere in the ancient family tree. We all lived in the same neighborhood. So, this ‘not-so-charming’ girl used to visit often.”

She smirks, shaking her head.  
**She:**  
“Girls just keep falling into your lap, huh?”

He shrugs, chuckling.  
**He:**  
“Beats me. Honestly, I still don’t get how I pulled *you*. I mean, you’re a straight 10/10 baddie, and yet... here we are.”

She acts like she’s flipping her hair.  
**She:**  
“Damn right. Now keep going—I want to hear where this one crashes.”

**He:**  
“Alright, so one day, my cousin’s mom called me over. I thought it was just some errand, but nope—both girls were sitting there, getting a lecture from aunty.”  
*He smiles a little at the memory.*  
“Apparently, since I was the ‘studious one’ with good grades, aunty thought I’d be a great tutor for both of them—Maths, Physics, Chem. And so began the evening tuition sessions at their place.”

**She:**  
“Let me guess—fate played its role?”

**He:**  
“Exactly. I didn’t try to mix with them, but fate clearly didn’t care. A few months in, she started getting bolder. Closer. I noticed it... but said nothing. I wanted to see how far she’d go.”

*He takes a second here, remembering.*

**He:**  
“And yeah, she went far. After four-five months of tutoring and chatting more during college hours, she somehow got my number from my cousin. Started with study doubts... then flirting.”  
*He makes a small ‘tsk’ noise.*  
“And one day, she proposed. And me being the ‘go with the flow’ kind of guy... well, I got another girlfriend.”

She mock gasps.  
**She:**  
“You really are a playboy, huh?”

**He:**  
“I’m not!”

She raises a brow, leaning toward him slightly.  
**She:**  
“Oh, but you’re walking the path. You’ve got the potential. And tell me—why is it always the girl who confesses? Even *I* had to confess first.”

He, grinning like a fool now:  
**He:**  
“That’s just... the effect of my charm.”

She, narrowing her eyes:  
**She:**  
“Cheeky little shit. Do you want me to start feeding you porridge from now on?”

He, confused:  
**He:**  
“Wait, why?”

**She:**  
“Because you won’t have teeth left to chew with if you keep this up.”

*He bursts out laughing, trying to cover his mouth as if it would save him.*
