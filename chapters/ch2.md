### **INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

The lighting is dim. Shadows stretch across the room as the remnants of a long night linger — glasses half-full, ashtray overflowing, the air thick with smoke and unspoken words.

Ariv sets his glass down with a slow, mechanical clink. He reaches for a cigarette — the motion familiar, practiced. The flame sparks, igniting the tip. Smoke coils around his face like a veil, briefly hiding whatever storm brews behind his eyes.

He doesn’t look at anyone. Just exhales, then speaks.

**ARIV** _(low, deliberate)_  
"So... how’s the preparation going?"

The shift is instant. The teasing dies. Silence spreads like ink in water. DK and Vir exchange a brief glance — no need for context. They all know exactly what Ariv means.

**VIR** _(leaning forward, calm but serious)_  
"I’ve got intel. Sent a decoy after him. We’re watching his moves."

Ariv nods slowly, his eyes narrowing just a little. The cigarette hangs at his lips, untouched.

**ARIV** _(quiet, calculated)_  
"Hmm. The situation’s changed. We’ll have to pivot. Adjust the plan."

**DK** _(leaning back with a smirk, voice edged with irony)_  
"Can’t even break up properly and now all our plans are in shambles. Bravo, Ariv."

Ariv doesn’t react. Not outwardly. But there’s the faintest shift in his shoulders, like a man quietly absorbing a punch.

He takes a long drag, exhales through his nose.

**ARIV** _(voice softer, reluctant)_  
"I tried, DK. Honestly. But she... clung harder than I thought. And I—"  
_(he hesitates)_  
"I got softer."

He looks away. A faint flush creeps up his neck. He rarely stumbles over words — but now, even breathing feels like confession.

**DK** _(snorting, half-mocking)_  
"Look at this guy. Mr. 'Cold and Calculated' turned into a puppy."

**VIR** _(cool, grounded)_  
"Let bygones be bygones. The path may have changed, but the destination remains the same."

DK gives him a look, head tilted, a grin crawling back.

**DK** _(tapping his temple theatrically)_  
"Alcohol really brings out the philosopher in people. Why can’t I speak like that? Why am I not wise?"

Ariv and Vir exchange a glance. A shared smirk. No words needed — they’ve been through too much.

**DK** _(mock defensive)_  
"Don’t look at me like that. I’m not an idiot. Scored 80% in boards, remember?"

**VIR** _(raising an eyebrow, deadpan)_  
"Still lower than ours."

**DK** _(shrugging dramatically)_  
"That’s 'cause you two had no lives. I had priorities. Social balance. Healthy lifestyle."

The humor fades. Ariv’s eyes darken again, jaw tightens. He taps ash into the tray.

**ARIV** _(focused)_  
"Vir, let’s set it in motion."

Vir picks up on the tone immediately.

**VIR** _(cautious)_  
"You sure? This isn’t the original plan. Things could spiral."

Ariv stubs out his cigarette with quiet finality. His hand lingers for a moment, curled into a fist before relaxing. He meets Vir’s gaze directly.

**ARIV** _(steady, certain)_  
"I’ll handle it. Just stick to your part."

DK leans forward, his grin turning into something more solid. There’s respect in his tone now.

**DK** _(slapping Ariv’s back)_  
"Now _that’s_ the confidence I like to see."

Ariv exhales, the weight of camaraderie settling on his shoulders. He leans back, letting the comfort of old friends seep in.

**ARIV** _(low, resolute)_  
"You guys are my confidence. With you two... I can take on anything."

DK swirls the last bit of whiskey in his glass, his voice dropping a notch — blunt, but not cruel.

**DK**  
"So... you sure about her? I mean, looking at your history... it’s disappointment after disappointment. What makes this time different?"

Ariv lights another cigarette. He doesn’t meet anyone’s eyes — just watches the smoke spiral upward, lost in thought.

**ARIV** _(quietly)_  
"I don’t know, man. I really don’t. Maybe fate’s already decided. Guess we’ll see."

Silence falls again. Thick with memory, regret, and that quiet ache of history repeating.

**DK** _(matter-of-fact)_  
"You know who we’re up against. And honestly... I only see one ending here."

**VIR** _(snapping, sharp)_  
"DK, don’t. You’re killing his morale."

**DK** _(shrugging)_  
"I’m not mocking him. I pity him, if anything."

Ariv lets out a hollow laugh, eyes half-lidded, voice tinged with resignation.

**ARIV**  
"History’s consistent. Every time, someone will take her away. Maybe it’s fate. Maybe I’m just not meant for this love thing."

Vir silently pours another drink and slides it across the table toward him.

**VIR**  
"Drink. Stop overthinking."

DK raises both hands, sensing tension.

**DK**  
"Okay, okay. My bad. If it _does_ happen again... just screw this dating mess. Ask your parents to get you married."

Vir shoots him a glare so sharp it could cut glass.

**DK** _(grinning)_  
"Alright, alright. I’m done. Total silence. Shhhh..."

**VIR** _(to Ariv, softer)_  
"Ignore him. He gets mouthy when drunk."

**DK** _(mock offended)_  
"I’m not an idiot."

**VIR** _(deadpan)_  
"Yes, you are. Zero filter. Just full broadcast mode."

Ariv chuckles, but it’s faint — the kind of laugh that never touches the eyes.

**ARIV**  
"It’s alright. He’s not wrong. Sometimes... the truth helps. Even if it stings."

Vir places a hand on Ariv’s shoulder — steady, grounding.

**VIR**  
"Don’t spiral. Drink. Sleep. We’ll figure the rest out tomorrow. With clear heads."

### **[INT. HIS APARTMENT – MORNING]**

The room is a mess. Bottles and half-eaten snack packets lie scattered on the floor. The window’s slightly open, letting in the soft golden light of morning. It's 8 a.m. A gentle breeze flutters the curtain as birds chirp somewhere outside.

On the bed, three guys are knocked out cold.

DK is draped over Ariv—one leg across his stomach, an arm over his shoulder like a clingy koala. Vir lies at the edge of the bed, untouched by the chaos, like someone meditating mid-apocalypse.

A phone buzzes with an alarm.

A hand shoots out and silences it. Vir blinks awake, rubs his eyes, and squints at the light. He glances at the tangle of limbs beside him—DK wrapped around Ariv like a comfort pillow. A faint smile touches his lips... then fades as he takes in the room.

Empty bottles roll across the floor. Snack wrappers flutter in the wind.

Vir exhales. There’s an unspoken rule in the house—whoever wakes up first cleans up the mess. And since Ariv and DK sleep like they’ve been buried in a tomb, it’s almost always Vir.

He sighs, gets up, and starts picking up bottles. One has a little drink left—he lifts it, sniffs it, shrugs, and downs it like a man who's found the last drop of life-saving elixir.

He tosses the bottle in the trash, lights a cigarette, and grabs a broom. The clinking of glass stirs the dead.

Ariv blinks awake, groans as he finds himself coiled in DK’s grip again. He slowly peels DK’s arm off, then shoves his leg aside. DK grunts but doesn’t wake.

Ariv sits up and looks around. The room is already half-clean. Vir stands near the desk, broom in one hand, cigarette in the other, staring out the window like a tired father watching his children ruin everything.

Their eyes meet.

Ariv lifts a lazy thumbs-up.

**VIR**  
Why don’t you come help, _for once_?

**ARIV** _(yawning)_  
What's left? Just sweeping. And I believe in you. You’ve got this.

Vir doesn’t even blink.

**VIR**  
You guys only know how to eat and drink. Not clean.

**ARIV**  
Don't be salty. I _was_ planning to clean today.

**VIR**  
Then why are you still on the bed?

**ARIV**  
You woke up before me. What can I do now? Fate chose you.

**VIR**  
Go wash the dishes before the stains fossilize.

Ariv slides off the bed and stretches like he’s in a yoga class.

**VIR**  
I swear to god, I’ll dislocate a few of your bones.

**ARIV** _(smirking)_  
Jealous of the physique, huh?

**VIR**  
Start washing, or I’ll beat the crap out of that “physique.”

**ARIV**  
Relax, relax. No need for violence.

He walks over, takes the cigarette from Vir, takes a puff like it’s therapy.

**ARIV** _(exhaling)_  
Mmm. That’s the good stuff.

**VIR**  
Watch your step—crumbs all over.

**ARIV**  
Oops.

He flicks the cigarette into the ashtray and heads to the kitchen, tying on his favorite apron like it’s armor. He starts doing the dishes, whistling the same off-key tune he always does. The kettle’s on, water heating up for tea.

In the background, DK turns over and mutters something in his sleep.

Ariv doesn't even look back.

**ARIV**  
(quietly, to himself)  
One day... I’ll wake up last.

---

**[Interior – Morning – Soft classical music plays low in the background. The sun filters through the curtains.]**

**Ariv** is in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, sipping coffee between scrubbing dishes. **Vir** hums quietly as he brooms and dusts the room. The rustling and clinks stir **DK** from his sleep. He sits up groggily on the mattress, rubbing his eyes.

**Vir** (without turning):
“Get out of bed. I’ll fold the blankets.”

**DK** (groaning):
“What’s the rush?”

**Vir** (checking the wall clock):
“It’s already 8:20.”

**DK** (stretching with a loud yawn):
“Oh. Well, I guess it’s time to wake up then…”

He gets up, scratching his back lazily and shuffles into the kitchen.

**DK** (peering into the fridge):
“Do we have any drink left?”

**Vir** turns to stare daggers at him while folding the blanket with military precision.

**DK** (backpedaling):
“Okay okay, don’t get mad…”

DK then grins mischievously and sneaks up behind Ariv at the sink.

**DK** (teasing):
“You look like a housewife doing all this. So... what’s for breakfast today, *my darling?*”

He gives Ariv a light slap at the bottom.

**Ariv** (flinching, flustered):
“Hey! Maintain your damn dignity. Don’t touch people like that!”

**DK** (laughing):
“Oho! Now you *really* sound like a housewife... offended by another man’s touch.”

Ariv stares at him, red in the face.

**Ariv**:
“I swear I’ll beat the shit out of you.”

**DK**:
“With those delicate hands? What’re you gonna do, throw a pillow at me?”

He wraps his arms around Ariv from behind, overly dramatic.

**DK** (sniffing):
“You smell good. Did you change your shampoo?”

**Ariv** (struggling, half-laughing):
“Stop acting like some lusty old uncle!”

He shouts out toward the living room:

**Ariv**:
“Hey Vir! You sure DK’s not gay? ‘Cause the way he’s acting…”

**Vir**, who’s been silently watching the whole thing unfold from the doorway, raises an eyebrow.

**Vir** (deadpan):
“I don’t know. Maybe we should ask his girlfriend.”

**DK** (startled):
“Hey! Don’t bring her into this! I was just messing around.”

**Vir** (smirking as he folds the last blanket):
“Well, I think we should tell her. Might be a little shocking... but she deserves to know the truth.”

**Ariv** walks out of the kitchen, coffee mug in hand, nodding with mock seriousness.

**Ariv**:
“Yeah, we should inform her. ‘The man you love... might actually love men.’”

**DK**, still in the kitchen, panics a little, fumbling for words.

**Vir**:
“You’ve seen how he cuddles you at night, Ariv.”

**Ariv** (quickly):
“Hey hey, don’t bring me into this! He’s the one coiling around me!”

**Vir** (trying not to laugh):
“But you never resist, do you?”

**Ariv**:
“I *do*! I’ve even slapped him in his sleep!”

**DK** (mock hurt):
“So *that’s* why I wake up with a sore cheek sometimes…”

**Vir** (grinning):
“So... who’s gay here?”

**Ariv**:
“No one’s gay, damn it! Enough. Let’s make breakfast.”

**DK** (pointing dramatically at Vir):
“I think *he* is.”

**Ariv** (raising an eyebrow):
“Oh? Why?”

**DK**:
“He keeps his distance. Doesn’t even let anyone *accidentally* touch him in bed. Always sleeping on the edge, like a chastity monk.”

**Ariv**:
“That… doesn’t make any sense. But... suspicious.”

**Vir** plops down on the chair, expression deadpan.

**Vir**:
“You know what? I’m changing my room. I can’t live with these two idiots.”

---

**(Ariv and Vir are in the kitchen, with Vir chopping veggies and Ariv flipping the chapatis. The clatter of kitchen utensils fills the air, mixing with the faint hum of classical music playing from the speaker.)**

**(DK is sitting at the table, drumming his fingers impatiently, staring at the dishes being prepared. He leans back in his chair, glancing over at them, looking slightly irritated.)**

**DK:** *(grumbling as he eyes the burnt chapatis)*  
"Hey, the chapati's burned on the side."

**Vir:** *(without looking up, focused on his work, a slight frown of concentration on his face)*  
"Eat quietly, DK."

**DK:** *(raising an eyebrow, gesturing at the burned chapatis with a dramatic sweep of his hand)*  
"Why’ve you given me all the burned ones while you two eat the good ones?"

**Ariv:** *(snorts, shaking his head while turning the next chapati over with a swift, precise motion)*  
"Because you didn’t help."

**DK:** *(grinning, trying to defend himself, a bit flustered)*  
"What do you mean 'didn't help'? I arranged the table!"

**Ariv:** *(pauses for a beat, his voice dry but laced with mock seriousness as he flips another chapati)*  
"And?"

**DK:** *(his smile falters, then he puffs his chest a little, standing up straight in an exaggerated motion)*  
"I poured water in the glasses!"

**Ariv:** *(gives DK a deadpan look, keeping his hands busy with the cooking, unaffected)*  
"And?"

**DK:** *(sputtering now, voice raised with mock indignation, his arms gesturing as if he's making an argument in court)*  
"This is not how you treat someone! I’m going to complain to your mother."

**Vir:** *(lets out a short, unamused chuckle from the corner, not missing a beat)*  
"And what exactly will you complain about?"

**DK:** *(dramatically placing a hand on his chest as if wounded, his eyes narrowing playfully, and speaking with exaggerated gravitas)*  
"That you gave me burnt chapati to eat!"

**(Vir and Ariv snicker, exchanging a brief, knowing glance. Ariv lowers the chapati onto the hot pan, his lips curling into a small smirk.)**

**Ariv:** *(his voice filled with amusement, but his eyes stay focused on the cooking)*  
"You reap what you sow, DK. Should've helped us out."

**DK:** *(mock pouting, crossing his arms defiantly)*  
"I’ll remember this, you know. When the time comes…"

**Vir:** *(glances over at DK, his voice low and teasing, an eyebrow raised as he leans against the counter)*  
"Yeah? And what can you even do about it?"

**DK:** *(eyes twinkling with mischief, suddenly standing up from the table, walking towards them with a confident grin)*  
"Hmm, I’ll order takeout tonight, eat it right in front of you both, and not give you a single piece."

**Ariv:** *(pauses, flicking his wrist dismissively as he places the final chapati on a plate, voice laced with sarcasm)*  
"Are you sure you can even eat in front of us, DK?"

**DK:** *(stops mid-step, a dramatic pause before turning back to Vir with mock seriousness, eyes widening)*  
"Ah, okay, change of plan... I’ll eat at a restaurant and send you both pictures of me enjoying every bite."

**Vir:** *(a small, knowing smirk plays on his lips as he crosses his arms, giving DK an unimpressed look)*  
"Are you sure you’ll be able to come back here after that?"

**DK:** *(hurls his hands in the air, half in frustration, half in jest)*  
"Fuck. Just give me a good chapati to eat. Don’t do this to me."

**(Vir, with a slight chuckle, grabs a fresh, golden-brown chapati from the pan and slides it onto the plate. He passes it over to DK with an exaggerated flourish.)**

**DK:** *(picking it up, taking a slow, dramatic bite, his voice full of mock reverence)*  
"Hmmm, this one's good. Although, the veggie’s a bit bland... needs more salt."

**(Ariv and Vir exchange another glance, their facial expressions subtly shifting, amused but slightly resigned.)**

**Vir:** *(leaning back against the counter, arms crossed, shaking his head with a sigh)*  
"Really? Now you have the nerve to critique the food after all that drama?"

**DK:** *(grinning widely, leaning back in his chair as he chews, his voice muffled as he speaks through a mouthful of food)*  
"Yeah, well... I’m eating it without a word now. I promise."

**Ariv:** *(grumbling under his breath as he hands DK a glass of water, his face flushed with a mix of irritation and amusement)*  
"Eat already, you drama king."

**Vir:** *(snorts, watching DK’s antics with a bemused expression, his voice dry)*  
"Should’ve known better than to try and make this easy."

**DK:** *(with a dramatic flourish, taking a sip of water before flashing an exaggerated smile at both of them)*  
"You two have no idea what you're getting into. I’ll have you both begging for takeout by the end of the day."

---

**(The room falls silent after the playful teasing. Ariv and Vir are sitting at the table, each chewing thoughtfully. The atmosphere shifts as the plan is about to be discussed, the light-heartedness replaced by a palpable tension.)**

**Ariv:** *(looking up from his plate, voice low and serious)*  
"We'll start the plan today. You ready?"

**(Vir, who had been messing with DK, looks over at Ariv, his playful demeanor dropping as he meets Ariv’s gaze. The room feels heavier now, the clatter of utensils fading into the background.)**

**Vir:** *(nodding slowly, his tone grave, eyes focused)*  
"Yes, I'm ready."

**Ariv:** *(leaning forward slightly, his tone calm but firm, his hands folding neatly on the table)*  
"All the preparation is done. We follow the plan from here."

**DK:** *(leaning back in his chair, arms crossed, with a worried look in his eyes, voice tinged with concern)*  
"What if he finds out during the act?"

**Ariv:** *(without hesitation, his gaze unwavering as he locks eyes with DK, his voice calm but authoritative)*  
"I'll make it work. Just do your part properly."

**Vir:** *(glancing over at Ariv, then at DK, his voice soft but serious)*  
"So, when do we start? Meeting him during class hour is impossible. He's always surrounded."

**DK:** *(rolling his eyes, tone dripping with sarcasm, but also a hint of frustration)*  
"Yeah, he's always surrounded by those... butterflies. I don’t know what they see in him. I’m much more handsome than he is."

**(Vir and Ariv share an exasperated glance, their eyes narrowing in mock disbelief as they turn their attention back to DK.)**

**DK:** *(looking at them, frowning, almost pouting)*  
"What? I’m not handsome? My girlfriend says I’m the most handsome."

**Vir:** *(snorts, shaking his head with a knowing smirk, voice dripping with sarcasm)*  
"I think your girlfriend needs to see an eye doctor. She really, really needs it."

**DK:** *(eyes widening, half offended, half amused, as he gestures toward them)*  
"Hey!"

**Ariv:** *(cutting in mid-sentence, a subtle smirk tugging at the corners of his lips, his tone sharp but playful)*  
"I think she just consoles you so you don’t feel bad about your face."

**DK:** *(his face twisting into mock betrayal, hands dramatically clutching his chest as if wounded)*  
"Even you, Ariv? I never thought you’d backstab me like that."

**Ariv:** *(shrugs nonchalantly, his tone cool but matter-of-fact)*  
"I’m stating the truth. And truth is always hard to digest."

**(Vir, trying to hold back his laughter, lets out a soft snicker, shaking his head as he looks at Ariv with an expression of amused disbelief.)**

**Vir:** *(chuckling lightly, glancing at Ariv with a playful glint in his eyes)*  
"So, have you tested it?"

**Ariv:** *(nodding without hesitation, his expression turning more serious, voice steady but confident)*  
"Yeah, I’ve been working on it for a few days. It's ready."

**(Ariv shifts in his seat slightly, then turns to DK, his gaze intensifying, the weight of his words clear.)**

**Ariv:** *(his voice steady, almost commanding)*  
"Dk, it’s all on you now."

**DK:** *(nodding, his face serious but tinged with a bit of uncertainty)*  
"So, when do we surround him?"

**Vir:** *(his voice dropping, laced with a bit of frustration, leaning forward slightly as if measuring his words carefully)*  
"Meeting him during the day or class hour is impossible. Based on the intel I’ve got, he visits the convenience store often in the evening to get his cigs."

**Ariv:** *(nodding thoughtfully, his eyes narrowing as he processes the information)*  
"How many will be with him?"

**Vir:** *(his gaze flickering slightly as he recalls the details, voice soft but matter-of-fact)*  
"He usually goes with one person. I’ve seen him there several times."

**DK:** *(leaning back in his chair, an exaggerated look of disbelief crossing his face, his voice filled with mock shock)*  
"When did you go there?"

**Vir:** *(flustered now, his cheeks flushing slightly, voice defensive but soft)*  
"I went with my girlfriend the other day, okay? I saw him there."

**DK:** *(raising an eyebrow, his tone amused and slightly mocking)*  
"Huh? Who goes to a convenience store on a date? It’s such an odd place."

**Ariv:** *(gives DK an exasperated look, voice slightly irritated, but his tone still playful)*  
"Think outside the box, DK. He might’ve gone there to pick up something for his date."

**(Vir now looks completely flustered, his face turning a deeper shade of red as he avoids eye contact.)**

**Vir:** *(defensively, his tone awkward)*  
"Hey, we’re talking about him here, why are we talking about me?"

**DK:** *(grinning mischievously, leaning forward on the table with a mock serious expression, eyes narrowing as he presses the point)*  
"No, no, this is important too. So, if I’m right, you went with your girlfriend there to get balloons. Am I right?"

**(Vir goes completely silent, his face flushing bright red, a mix of embarrassment and surprise. He can’t bring himself to respond.)**

**Ariv:** *(leaning forward, voice playful but teasing as he raises an eyebrow)*  
"Yeah, the balloons you use to achieve nirvana. Am I right?"

**DK:** *(laughing, shaking his head with a mock appalled expression)*  
"Hmmm, pervy boy."

**Vir:** *(glancing at both of them, trying to maintain composure but now thoroughly embarrassed, mutters through gritted teeth)*  
"Don’t act like you don’t do it with your girlfriend."

**DK:** *(smirking, leaning back in his chair, fully aware of Vir’s discomfort, voice matter-of-fact)*  
"Yeah, I do. But I don’t hide it like it's some kind of demonic ritual."

**Ariv:** *(genuinely curious now, his eyes focused on DK, his voice softer as he asks a more thoughtful question)*  
"Hey, by the way, how does it feel?"

**DK:** *(his expression turning a little more serious, eyes distant for a second as he reflects, his voice steady but deep)*  
"Hmmm... it’s hard to explain in words. But, in short, you’ll feel like you’ve achieved nirvana. It’s like tasting immortal nectar."

**DK:** *(looking at Ariv with a small, sly grin, voice low and teasing)*  
"Yeah, you should try it once."

**Ariv:** *(raising an eyebrow, his tone dry but slightly amused as he leans back in his chair)*  
"I’ll think about it... but my situation doesn’t allow for that right now."

**Vir:** *(laughing softly, his tone playful but with a hint of warning)*  
"Yeah, don’t even try it with her, or we might never find your body afterward."

**DK:** *(nodding seriously, his face breaking into a mischievous grin as he leans forward to deliver his final, mock serious advice)*  
"Yeah, you should control yourself and stick to first base, at least until we’ve sorted this out."

then they all leave for there classess

**Scene: 3:00 PM – University Cafeteria, Rooftop**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm, golden hue over the university café perched on the mountainside. The open rooftop buzzed with laughter, plates clinking, and the distant hum of wind brushing against pine trees. From up here, the valley sprawled endlessly below, framed by snow-tipped peaks that looked like painted strokes.

 **DK** and **Vir** sat with their girlfriends, caught in animated conversation. Laughter erupted every few minutes—DK teasing Vir, Vir shooting back with exaggerated expressions, their girlfriends either giggling or playfully smacking their arms. Their world was full of color and noise.

At the other side of the table sat **Ariv**, alone.

He twirled his fork into the half-eaten pasta absentmindedly. His eyes weren’t on the food, nor the people. They were fixed on the distant mountains—silent, unmoving, as if waiting. The sun painted half his face in light, the other half cloaked in soft shadow. Wind played with his hair, but he didn’t seem to notice. He chewed slowly, like someone buying time.

Then—soft footsteps.

A shadow fell beside him. **Swasti.**

She slid onto the bench next to him without a word, placing her bag down gently. The table didn’t shake, but the air around them shifted. Even the laughter from DK’s table dimmed slightly, as if the moment had cupped its hands around them, shielding them from the rest of the world.

**Ariv** blinked, broken out of his trance. He turned and found **Swasti** smiling at him—her smile, not the playful, teasing one she wore for others. This was a quiet, knowing smile. The one only he got to see.

**Ariv (quietly):**  
"Why are you sitting so close? Go sit on the other bench."

**Swasti (tilting her head):**  
"Why? Do you own this seat?"

He looked at her for a second longer than he should’ve, then without a word, slipped his arm around her waist and pulled her closer.

Swasti’s eyes widened.

For a moment, she didn’t know how to react. This wasn’t like him. Ariv never allowed too much closeness, even when they were alone. And now… in public?

**Swasti (softly):**  
"You’re quite bold today."

**Ariv:**  
"I’ve made up my mind. No more running."

She blinked, and for a second, the mountains, the café, the world blurred. Her heartbeat drowned out the noises around her. Her cheeks flushed pink, and her lips parted as if to speak—but no words came out.

Ariv picked up a forkful of pasta, gently raised it toward her mouth. She hesitated… then leaned in and ate.

There was something sacred in the silence that followed.

Ariv glanced over at **DK** and **Vir**, who had been watching quietly. Both stood up. No goodbyes. No drama. Just a nod. A signal.

**Ariv (to Vir, without turning):**  
"I’m counting on you both."

**Vir** nodded subtly.  
**DK**, one hand raised in a lazy wave, called out without looking back:

**DK:**  
"Don’t mess this up, lover boy."

**Ariv’s** lips curled into the faintest smile.

Swasti turned to him, puzzled.

**Swasti:**  
"What was that about?"

Before she could get more out, Ariv raised another forkful to her lips.

**Ariv:**  
"You look more beautiful when you're not speaking."

She rolled her eyes and chewed in protest, shooting him a glare.

**Swasti:**  
"You’ve changed since yesterday. Does my kiss really have that much power?"

**Ariv (softly):**  
"Yeah... it did."

Swasti’s smile widened, glowing now.

**Swasti:**  
"I knew it. So what’s the occasion today? You’re… unusually sweet."

He said nothing. Just kept feeding her, one bite at a time, as if savoring something more than just a meal. His eyes were steady, but distant—like someone memorizing a moment.

She caught his wrist mid-air, frowning now. Her voice dipped lower.

**Swasti:**  
"Don’t tell me you’re still thinking about the breakup. This feels like giving food to a lamp before sacrificing it."

Ariv snorted, almost choked, then coughed lightly, wiping his mouth with a tissue. His laugh faded into a deep exhale.

**Ariv (gently):**  
"No. I’ve made up my mind… I’m going to pursue you. Do everything I can to keep you with me."

The words hit like a wave.

Swasti froze. Her fork clinked against the plate. For a heartbeat, she forgot how to breathe. The world slowed, sounds muffled. The wind against her skin, the heat from his body beside her—it all blurred into static. She could feel her cheeks reddening, a stupid smile crawling up her face before she could stop it.

She reached to hug him.

He stopped her gently, a hand on her shoulder.

**Ariv:**  
"Not here. Too many people."

**Swasti (half-whispering):**  
"So what?"

**Ariv (with a slight grin):**  
"I feel shy."

She shook her head, leaned closer, and whispered like a secret:

**Swasti:**  
"You’re cute when you’re shy."

**Scene: Rooftop Café, University – Late Afternoon**

The sun had dipped slightly lower now, casting amber streaks across the sky. The breeze had picked up, ruffling napkins, tugging lightly at Swasti’s hair. The smell of brewed coffee and sun-warmed concrete hung faintly in the air.

Ariv leaned back on the bench, elbow resting lazily on the wooden table. His fingers tapped the glass absentmindedly.

**Ariv (glancing sideways):**  
"So what are you doing here? Isn’t your class going on right now?"

Swasti sighed, looking off into the distance, voice quieter than usual.

**Swasti:**  
"I can’t concentrate on the classes anymore. Just needed some air... a breather."

**Ariv (brows furrowed):**  
"And why is that?"

She turned to him, lips pressing into a half-smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

**Swasti:**  
"You really have the courage to ask?"

**Ariv:**  
"Did I do something wrong?"

**Swasti (softly):**  
"It’s because of you, dummy."

Her voice lingered in the air. Neither spoke after that.

The two of them glanced around, suddenly aware of each other’s presence—their shoulders barely apart. Their eyes didn’t meet, but both were blushing faintly, hiding behind casual gestures. Ariv looked down at his drink. Swasti toyed with her bracelet.

**Swasti (after a pause):**  
"So… how was last night?"

**Ariv (without looking at her):**  
"Meaningful."

She leaned in slightly, intrigued.

**Swasti:**  
"Anything specific?"

**Ariv (shrugging):**  
"I don’t remember. I drank a lot... Slept like a log."

**Swasti (raising a brow):**  
"That’s disappointing."

**Ariv (softly):**  
"Well… I missed you. A lot."

Swasti froze for a second. Her breath caught.

He’d never said something like that before—not with this softness, not without a joke tied to the end. The words were small, but they carried weight.

She gently reached over and placed a hand on his mouth, her touch feather-light.

**Swasti (teasing, but voice trembling slightly):**  
"You’re getting quite cheeky... saying flirty things like that."

**Ariv (smirking):**  
"Well, you asked me."

**Swasti:**  
"You’ve never said things like this before."

**Ariv (meeting her gaze now):**  
"As I said... I stopped running from it."

The breeze danced between them. A few strands of her hair floated across her face. Ariv, without hesitation, reached up and tucked a strand behind her ear. The moment lingered.

**Ariv (softly):**  
"So... how was your night?"

**Swasti (half-laughing):**  
"Hmm. Meaningful. Drank with my roommates. I don’t remember much after that."

**Ariv (mockingly):**  
"Wow. You don’t even know what you did, and you're saying it was meaningful?"

**Swasti (raising an eyebrow):**  
"Okay, then tell me—did you look at my photo and blush while hitting the bed?"

**Ariv (with a sly smile):**  
"Hmm… I did."

She wasn’t expecting that. Her eyes widened slightly, color rushing to her cheeks.

He looked at her, enjoying her reaction.

**Ariv:**  
"Yeah… I blushed like that. They made fun of me."

Swasti, trying to keep her composure, looked away, flustered.

**Ariv (leaning in):**  
"So… did you do that too?"

She didn’t answer. Just nodded, quickly, embarrassed.

**Ariv (grinning):**  
"Expected."

He stood up, brushing his jeans.

**Ariv:**  
"Wait here. I’ll bring something to drink."

**Swasti:**  
"Hmm."

**Ariv:**  
"What do you want? Hot or cold?"

**Swasti (smirking):**  
"The environment’s pretty cold today... so bring me something cold."

**Ariv (pretending to ponder):**  
"That equation doesn’t seem to check out."

**Swasti (flashing a mischievous smile):**  
"Don’t mind it. You’ve already made me hot with all that flirting."

Ariv held back a chuckle, raising a hand like a knight at court.

**Ariv:**  
"As you wish, my lady."

He walked off.

Swasti leaned on the table, her eyes drifting across the rooftop. A small crowd had gathered near the railing. Girls were surrounding someone—laughter, playful shoves, the usual. Her eyes narrowed slightly.

She knew who it was. She didn’t want to care. But her body betrayed her curiosity.

Ariv, returning with two drinks, caught her gaze.

He followed it.

There, at the center, was *him*—the guy DK jokingly referred to as a butterfly magnet.

Ariv stared at the scene for a second, then remembered something DK had said, about how looks matter. About how some guys had it easier. He let out a quiet smirk.

Swasti caught it.

**Swasti:**  
"What got you smiling?"

**Ariv (still half-smiling):**  
"Just remembered something an idiot said."

**Swasti (playfully suspicious):**  
"What did DK say now?"

**Ariv (raising an eyebrow):**  
"Wait—why do you *assume* it was DK?"

**Swasti (smugly):**  
"Well... whenever you say 'idiot,' it’s basically code for DK."

**Ariv:**  
"Try not to say that around him. He might spike my drink."

**Swasti (laughing):**  
"You really fear him that much?"

**Ariv (passing the cold drink):**  
"There’s no cure for idiots."

Swasti snickered, then took a sip.

Her smile faded for a second as her eyes flicked back toward the crowd.

Ariv didn’t miss it.

**Ariv (quietly):**  
"So… what’s got you tense?"

**Swasti (quickly):**  
"Nothing. I’m alright."

But Ariv’s gaze followed hers.

**Ariv:**  
"Still not spilling the beans?"

**Swasti:**  
"What beans? There’s nothing going on."

**Ariv (sipping his drink):**  
"I smell NTR here."

Swasti snapped her head toward him.

Understanding what he meant, her jaw dropped.

She smacked his chest with the back of her hand.

**Swasti (offended):**  
"How could you *say* that? You really think something’s going on between me and him?"

**Ariv (mock-serious):**  
"Hey, I’m a man of culture. I’ve seen these tropes a lot. Girl gets nervous around a certain guy... starts hiding things... classic setup."

**Swasti:**  
"Keep quiet or I’ll break your teeth!"

Ariv returned to sipping his drink, eyes on her over the straw.

**Swasti (grumbling):**  
"There *is* something going on between us. But it’s not what you think."

**Ariv (deadpan):**  
"See? I *knew* it. I’m just a third wheel. Leave me. Go follow your heart."

Swasti clenched her fists. Her nostrils flared. She knew he was messing with her.

**Swasti (dead serious):**  
"You know, there’s a tradition in my family where women don’t hit their men."

Ariv side-eyed her.

**Ariv (sipping, casually):**  
"Mm-hmm."

**Swasti (gritting her teeth):**  
"And I think I might be the first girl to break that tradition."

He turned slightly toward her, his voice low, teasing.

**Ariv:**  
"So… are you gonna beat me?"

**Swasti:**  
"Yeah. You really need a good beating."

He looked at her again. This time, he didn’t smile.

**Ariv (calmly):**  
"But what I said... is it true or not?"

She went silent.

The wind rushed between them, fluttering her hair across her face again.

She didn’t answer immediately.

### **INT. MOUNTAIN CAFE – LATE AFTERNOON**

*Golden light drips through the windows, casting long shadows. It’s calm up here — quiet, like the world is on pause. Ariv and Swasti sit across a wooden table, two drinks almost done, a small silence sitting between them.*

*Ariv is lazily stirring the straw in his glass, eyes lost somewhere far.*

**Swasti**  
(sipping, then quietly)  
Well… my life’s a little complicated.

**Ariv**  
(not looking up)  
More than mine?

**Swasti**  
(smirks)  
No. Yours isn’t complicated. Yours is *fucked*.

*That gets a small reaction. Ariv finally glances at her, a faint smirk tugging at the corner of his lips. He raises his glass slightly like a toast, then sips again.*

**Swasti**  
You already know my connection with “him,” right?

**Ariv**  
(deadpan)  
Nope. Never heard of it.

**Swasti**  
I told you once. Don’t tell me you forgot.

**Ariv**  
Maybe I was drunk. Or just... too busy trying to not care.

**Swasti**  
(shakes head)  
You do realize how deep in the pit you’re stuck right now, right?

**Ariv**  
(sips, nods casually)  
Yeah, very deep. Like really deep.  
(leans back)  
So... go ahead, tell me again. I swear I’ll remember this time. Cross my heart.

*Swasti watches him for a moment, trying to decide if he’s messing around or actually listening. Ariv’s gaze is still elsewhere, like he’s hearing but not hearing.*

**Swasti**  
He and I were in the same school.  
(pause)  
Same kind of background. Same kind of... family.  
You already know how these families operate. It’s all about names, deals, appearances.

**Ariv**  
(twirls the straw)  
Hmm. Hmm. Right. Same old game.

**Swasti**  
I’m out here opening up and you’re not even reacting.

*Ariv suddenly snaps into mock performance. He quickly glances around, sits up straight, and does a dramatic impersonation of a sad girl.*

**Ariv**  
Oh my god, babe... that’s like... so *tragic*.  
I feel you. Your life is like, seriously messed up.

*Then instantly drops the act and takes another sip. Dead calm.*

**Swasti**  
(blinks, speechless)  
You’re impossible.

**Ariv**  
(smiling)  
I said my line. Now continue. I’m listening — this time for real.

**Swasti**  
(sighs)  
My family arranged a marriage between me and “him” while I was still in graduation.  
They said it would benefit the business — help both families grow.

**Ariv**  
So... you were used as a business pawn.

**Swasti**  
Exactly that.

**Ariv**  
(chuckles softly)  
What’s the big deal though? That’s how your people do things, right?

**Swasti**  
(raises eyebrow)  
You really don’t get it. I didn’t want someone else deciding my life for me. I’m not a piece on their damn chessboard.

**Ariv**  
But they’re your family. They wouldn’t want anything bad for you... would they?

*That line hits her unexpectedly. Swasti leans back slightly, her eyes shifting like she’s rethinking her own past.*

**Swasti**  
Maybe I was stupid back then... or maybe you’re right. I don’t know.  
But at that time, it felt like I had no way out.  
So I told them... either call off this marriage or I’d kill myself.

**Ariv**  
(quiet, sipping)  
Damn. That’s bold.  
Would you have really done it?

**Swasti**  
I don’t know.  
(pauses)  
I was scared. But I was also desperate. I needed a way out.  
Back then, that was the only door I saw.

**Ariv**  
And it worked?

**Swasti**  
It did.  
At least, my family backed off after that.  
But *he* didn’t. He kept coming... showing up at my place, messaging, talking to me at events... trying to change my mind.

**Ariv**  
(laughs a little)  
That’s cute. At least he put in effort.  
Not like me — I don’t even try.

*That last line slips out so casually, but it lingers. Swasti looks at him — something behind her gaze changes. She doesn’t reply, but her silence says enough.*

*A quiet moment passes. They both sit back. No more talking. Just the wind from the window and soft chimes from a wind bell outside.*

*They finish their drinks, almost in sync. Ariv crushes the cup slightly and tosses it toward the bin. Misses. Doesn’t care.*

---

### **EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL – DUSK**

*The sun sinks lower, painting the sky in shades of gold and violet. Crickets begin their song. The valley below stretches wide, endless.*

*Footsteps crunch over dirt and gravel. A gentle wind moves through the trees. They walk in silence.*

*Swasti keeps sneaking glances at Ariv. Like she’s searching for something in him — something even he might not know about himself.*

*Ariv notices, doesn’t comment. Lets the silence speak.*

*The trail bends again. A breeze picks up. He finally breaks it.*

**ariv:**  
so what happened after that.

**swasti:**  
nothing... i avoided him as much as i could, but we had to meet sometimes for business stuff. slowly his efforts faded. i felt relieved but—

*Ariv looks at her. Not interrupting, just... waiting.*

**swasti (softly):**  
—but a part of me always thought maybe it was all fake. just a phase. that maybe he’d come back stronger... so i ran. away from all of it. came here, doing my studies. peaceful place. easy to disappear.

**ariv (smirking):**  
so tell me one thing—how did a noble lady like *you* fall for *me*? huh? something feels off here.

*Swasti blinks. That caught her off guard.*

**swasti:**  
what are you trying to say?

**ariv:**  
just saying. you — daughter of a big-shot family — falling for a lowkey guy like me? something doesn’t add up. feels like... danger walked right into my quiet little corner.

**swasti:**  
you’re forgetting how we met.

**ariv:**  
how could i forget. biggest mistake of my life.

**swasti (hurt):**  
you think i’m a mistake?

**ariv:**  
nah. but your *dad* probably does.

*Swasti elbows him hard. He laughs, wincing.*

**swasti:**  
you’re mean.

**ariv:**  
so let me guess... you’re using me as a decoy, aren’t you?

**swasti:**  
what?

**ariv:**  
don’t play dumb. you know what i mean.

*She falls silent. His words sting. She gets it... and it hurts.*

**swasti (quietly):**  
it’s not like that. i’d never do that.

**ariv:**  
every girl says that. “i’d never do this, never do that” — and then they all do it.

**swasti:**  
i’m not like other girls.

**ariv (shrugs):**  
still a girl though... ain’t ya?

*Silence. Swasti stops. Her eyes glisten. It’s the second time he’s seen her like this.*

**ariv (immediately regretful):**  
hey... hey, i didn’t mean that. come on, don’t cry. please. hit me if you want, forget family rules — just... hit me, punch me, kick me—

**swasti (voice trembling):**  
shut up, you idiot.

**ariv (softly smiling):**  
yeah... i’m an idiot. here, take this.

*He pulls out a handkerchief, holds it out.*

**ariv:**  
clean your tears... and that little snot bubble. yeah, right there. it’s gross.

*She glares at him through her tears. Red cheeks. Red eyes. Furious. Flustered.*

*He stares at her. Something in his chest shifts. Everything goes quiet.*

*No one around. Just the two of them.*

*Then suddenly—he grabs her waist, pulls her close. Their lips meet. A stolen kiss. Soft, sudden, real.*

*Breaths mingled. Eyes locked. Time stilled.*

**ariv (barely a whisper):**  
i love you, idiot. even if you’re using me. even if it’s all a game. i’m still here... right now. and that’s all that matters.

*Swasti doesn’t speak. Her cheeks glow. Her eyes flicker with a thousand thoughts. She walks, flustered, eyes anywhere but his.*

**swasti (softly):**  
i’m not using you as a “decoy”... idiot.

**ariv (grinning):**  
hmm? did you say something?

*She doesn’t answer.*

**ariv (teasing):**  
you really should wipe your nose though. the snot’s back—

*Swasti instinctively touches her nose. Nothing. She glares at him.*

**swasti:**  
you little—

*He sees the danger and bolts.*

**ariv (laughing):**  
ahh shit—she’s gonna kill me!

*Swasti chases after him, yelling threats, laughing in between. The valley echoes with their voices. Somewhere between hate and love.*

EXT. OUTSIDE GIRLS' DORM – NIGHTFALL

They stop outside her dorm. It’s quiet. The soft hum of insects fills the silence. Swasti doesn’t say anything — too much happened today.

ariv
(softly)
Bye. Don’t think too much. I said that in the heat of the moment.

Swasti finally breaks the silence. Her voice still carries a touch of anger — he did make her cry.

swasti
Since when do you speak from emotion? Never seen that happen before.

Ariv scratches his temple, almost embarrassed.

ariv
Yeah well… now you have. You're the first witness.

swasti
Don’t dodge the question. What were you implying back there? That I’m using you? You idiot.

ariv
I don’t know. It just came out. After that day… I don’t know what’s happening to me.
(pauses)
And you’re responsible for that.

swasti
What did I do?

ariv
You made me a fool in love.

Swasti’s taken aback. She wasn’t expecting that. A tiny blush creeps up. She smiles.

swasti
Well, Mr. Fool... don’t say that again, or I will break your legs.

ariv
Yeah yeah. My bad. I said something I shouldn’t’ve.

swasti
Good. Glad you get it.

She starts walking toward the dorm gate. Then without turning—

swasti
By the way… I liked that sneak attack you did.
Try that more often, and I won’t stay mad.

Ariv’s caught off guard. He blushes this time. She glances back and smiles. He waves her goodbye.

As Ariv walks off into the evening, he mutters to himself—

ariv
Girls really can get away with anything just by crying.
Maybe I should try that too.
Crying with a little begging? Hmm… could work.
Yeah… needs more testing.

He pulls out his phone. Dials.

ariv
Hello?

vir
Yeah. What’s up?

ariv
Get ready. We’re doing it.

Vir’s tone immediately turns serious.

vir
Okay. I’ll start the prep.

ariv
Switching off my phone after this. Wait for my call.

vir
Hmm. Best of luck.

ariv
Yeah… same to you.

vir
We’re not doing birthday wishes, bro. What “same to you”?

ariv
What do you mean? People say “same to you” for birthday too.

vir
No bro, that’s for New Year wishes or stuff like that.

ariv
Tch. Stay away from DK. His effect is rubbing off on you.

vir
You might be right.
(looks at DK)
Hey DK, go sit on the other bench.

dk
Huh? Why?

vir
Nothing. Just go.

(DK moves. Confused.)

vir
Yeah bro, he was too close. My IQ dropped a little.

ariv
Good. Keep your mind sharp. We can’t afford mistakes now.

vir
Yeah. Good luck.

ariv
Same to y—
(call cuts)

ariv
Smart boy.

Back on the other end, Vir looks out at the pine trees.

vir
(sighs)
What day has come that we’re counting on DK…

dk
You said something?

vir
Nah. Carry on.

dk
What the hell is wrong with him?
