Swasti leaned on the table, her eyes drifting across the rooftop. A small crowd had gathered near the railing. Girls were surrounding someone—laughter, playful shoves, the usual. Her eyes narrowed slightly.

She knew who it was. She didn’t want to care. But her body betrayed her curiosity.

Ariv, returning with two drinks, caught her gaze.

He followed it.

There, at the center, was *him*—the guy DK jokingly referred to as a butterfly magnet.

Ariv stared at the scene for a second, then remembered something DK had said, about how looks matter. About how some guys had it easier. He let out a quiet smirk.

Swasti caught it.

**Swasti:**  
"What got you smiling?"

**Ariv (still half-smiling):**  
"Just remembered something an idiot said."

**Swasti (playfully suspicious):**  
"What did DK say now?"

**Ariv (raising an eyebrow):**  
"Wait—why do you *assume* it was DK?"

**Swasti (smugly):**  
"Well... whenever you say 'idiot,' it’s basically code for DK."

**Ariv:**  
"Try not to say that around him. He might spike my drink."

**Swasti (laughing):**  
"You really fear him that much?"

**Ariv (passing the cold drink):**  
"There’s no cure for idiots."

Swasti snickered, then took a sip.

Her smile faded for a second as her eyes flicked back toward the crowd.

Ariv didn’t miss it.

**Ariv (quietly):**  
"So… what’s got you tense?"

**Swasti (quickly):**  
"Nothing. I’m alright."

But Ariv’s gaze followed hers.

**Ariv:**  
"Still not spilling the beans?"

**Swasti:**  
"What beans? There’s nothing going on."

**Ariv (sipping his drink):**  
"I smell NTR here."

Swasti snapped her head toward him.

Understanding what he meant, her jaw dropped.

She smacked his chest with the back of her hand.

**Swasti (offended):**  
"How could you *say* that? You really think something’s going on between me and him?"

**Ariv (mock-serious):**  
"Hey, I’m a man of culture. I’ve seen these tropes a lot. Girl gets nervous around a certain guy... starts hiding things... classic setup."

**Swasti:**  
"Keep quiet or I’ll break your teeth!"

Ariv returned to sipping his drink, eyes on her over the straw.

**Swasti (grumbling):**  
"There *is* something going on between us. But it’s not what you think."

**Ariv (deadpan):**  
"See? I *knew* it. I’m just a third wheel. Leave me. Go follow your heart."

Swasti clenched her fists. Her nostrils flared. She knew he was messing with her.

**Swasti (dead serious):**  
"You know, there’s a tradition in my family where women don’t hit their men."

Ariv side-eyed her.

**Ariv (sipping, casually):**  
"Mm-hmm."

**Swasti (gritting her teeth):**  
"And I think I might be the first girl to break that tradition."

He turned slightly toward her, his voice low, teasing.

**Ariv:**  
"So… are you gonna beat me?"

**Swasti:**  
"Yeah. You really need a good beating."

He looked at her again. This time, he didn’t smile.

**Ariv (calmly):**  
"But what I said... is it true or not?"

She went silent.

The wind rushed between them, fluttering her hair across her face again.

She didn’t answer immediately.

### **INT. MOUNTAIN CAFE – LATE AFTERNOON**

*Golden light drips through the windows, casting long shadows. It’s calm up here — quiet, like the world is on pause. Ariv and Swasti sit across a wooden table, two drinks almost done, a small silence sitting between them.*

*Ariv is lazily stirring the straw in his glass, eyes lost somewhere far.*

**Swasti**  
(sipping, then quietly)  
Well… my life’s a little complicated.

**Ariv**  
(not looking up)  
More than mine?

**Swasti**  
(smirks)  
No. Yours isn’t complicated. Yours is *fucked*.

*That gets a small reaction. Ariv finally glances at her, a faint smirk tugging at the corner of his lips. He raises his glass slightly like a toast, then sips again.*

**Swasti**  
You already know my connection with “him,” right?

**Ariv**  
(deadpan)  
Nope. Never heard of it.

**Swasti**  
I told you once. Don’t tell me you forgot.

**Ariv**  
Maybe I was drunk. Or just... too busy trying to not care.

**Swasti**  
(shakes head)  
You do realize how deep in the pit you’re stuck right now, right?

**Ariv**  
(sips, nods casually)  
Yeah, very deep. Like really deep.  
(leans back)  
So... go ahead, tell me again. I swear I’ll remember this time. Cross my heart.

*Swasti watches him for a moment, trying to decide if he’s messing around or actually listening. Ariv’s gaze is still elsewhere, like he’s hearing but not hearing.*

**Swasti**  
He and I were in the same school.  
(pause)  
Same kind of background. Same kind of... family.  
You already know how these families operate. It’s all about names, deals, appearances.

**Ariv**  
(twirls the straw)  
Hmm. Hmm. Right. Same old game.

**Swasti**  
I’m out here opening up and you’re not even reacting.

*Ariv suddenly snaps into mock performance. He quickly glances around, sits up straight, and does a dramatic impersonation of a sad girl.*

**Ariv**  
Oh my god, babe... that’s like... so *tragic*.  
I feel you. Your life is like, seriously messed up.

*Then instantly drops the act and takes another sip. Dead calm.*

**Swasti**  
(blinks, speechless)  
You’re impossible.

**Ariv**  
(smiling)  
I said my line. Now continue. I’m listening — this time for real.

**Swasti**  
(sighs)  
My family arranged a marriage between me and “him” while I was still in graduation.  
They said it would benefit the business — help both families grow.

**Ariv**  
So... you were used as a business pawn.

**Swasti**  
Exactly that.

**Ariv**  
(chuckles softly)  
What’s the big deal though? That’s how your people do things, right?

**Swasti**  
(raises eyebrow)  
You really don’t get it. I didn’t want someone else deciding my life for me. I’m not a piece on their damn chessboard.

**Ariv**  
But they’re your family. They wouldn’t want anything bad for you... would they?

*That line hits her unexpectedly. Swasti leans back slightly, her eyes shifting like she’s rethinking her own past.*

**Swasti**  
Maybe I was stupid back then... or maybe you’re right. I don’t know.  
But at that time, it felt like I had no way out.  
So I told them... either call off this marriage or I’d kill myself.

**Ariv**  
(quiet, sipping)  
Damn. That’s bold.  
Would you have really done it?

**Swasti**  
I don’t know.  
(pauses)  
I was scared. But I was also desperate. I needed a way out.  
Back then, that was the only door I saw.

**Ariv**  
And it worked?

**Swasti**  
It did.  
At least, my family backed off after that.  
But *he* didn’t. He kept coming... showing up at my place, messaging, talking to me at events... trying to change my mind.

**Ariv**  
(laughs a little)  
That’s cute. At least he put in effort.  
Not like me — I don’t even try.

*That last line slips out so casually, but it lingers. Swasti looks at him — something behind her gaze changes. She doesn’t reply, but her silence says enough.*

*A quiet moment passes. They both sit back. No more talking. Just the wind from the window and soft chimes from a wind bell outside.*

*They finish their drinks, almost in sync. Ariv crushes the cup slightly and tosses it toward the bin. Misses. Doesn’t care.*


### **EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL – DUSK**

*The sun sinks lower, painting the sky in shades of gold and violet. Crickets begin their song. The valley below stretches wide, endless.*

*Footsteps crunch over dirt and gravel. A gentle wind moves through the trees. They walk in silence.*

*Swasti keeps sneaking glances at Ariv. Like she’s searching for something in him — something even he might not know about himself.*

*Ariv notices, doesn’t comment. Lets the silence speak.*

*The trail bends again. A breeze picks up. He finally breaks it.*

**ariv:**  
so what happened after that.

**swasti:**  
nothing... i avoided him as much as i could, but we had to meet sometimes for business stuff. slowly his efforts faded. i felt relieved but—

*Ariv looks at her. Not interrupting, just... waiting.*

**swasti (softly):**  
—but a part of me always thought maybe it was all fake. just a phase. that maybe he’d come back stronger... so i ran. away from all of it. came here, doing my studies. peaceful place. easy to disappear.

**ariv (smirking):**  
so tell me one thing—how did a noble lady like *you* fall for *me*? huh? something feels off here.

*Swasti blinks. That caught her off guard.*

**swasti:**  
what are you trying to say?

**ariv:**  
just saying. you — daughter of a big-shot family — falling for a lowkey guy like me? something doesn’t add up. feels like... danger walked right into my quiet little corner.

**swasti:**  
you’re forgetting how we met.

**ariv:**  
how could i forget. biggest mistake of my life.

**swasti (hurt):**  
you think i’m a mistake?

**ariv:**  
nah. but your *dad* probably does.

*Swasti elbows him hard. He laughs, wincing.*

**swasti:**  
you’re mean.

**ariv:**  
so let me guess... you’re using me as a decoy, aren’t you?

**swasti:**  
what?

**ariv:**  
don’t play dumb. you know what i mean.

*She falls silent. His words sting. She gets it... and it hurts.*

**swasti (quietly):**  
it’s not like that. i’d never do that.

**ariv:**  
every girl says that. “i’d never do this, never do that” — and then they all do it.

**swasti:**  
i’m not like other girls.

**ariv (shrugs):**  
still a girl though... ain’t ya?

*Silence. Swasti stops. Her eyes glisten. It’s the second time he’s seen her like this.*

**ariv (immediately regretful):**  
hey... hey, i didn’t mean that. come on, don’t cry. please. hit me if you want, forget family rules — just... hit me, punch me, kick me—

**swasti (voice trembling):**  
shut up, you idiot.

**ariv (softly smiling):**  
yeah... i’m an idiot. here, take this.

*He pulls out a handkerchief, holds it out.*

**ariv:**  
clean your tears... and that little snot bubble. yeah, right there. it’s gross.

*She glares at him through her tears. Red cheeks. Red eyes. Furious. Flustered.*

*He stares at her. Something in his chest shifts. Everything goes quiet.*

*No one around. Just the two of them.*

*Then suddenly—he grabs her waist, pulls her close. Their lips meet. A stolen kiss. Soft, sudden, real.*

*Breaths mingled. Eyes locked. Time stilled.*

**ariv (barely a whisper):**  
i love you, idiot. even if you’re using me. even if it’s all a game. i’m still here... right now. and that’s all that matters.

*Swasti doesn’t speak. Her cheeks glow. Her eyes flicker with a thousand thoughts. She walks, flustered, eyes anywhere but his.*

**swasti (softly):**  
i’m not using you as a “decoy”... idiot.

**ariv (grinning):**  
hmm? did you say something?

*She doesn’t answer.*

**ariv (teasing):**  
you really should wipe your nose though. the snot’s back—

*Swasti instinctively touches her nose. Nothing. She glares at him.*

**swasti:**  
you little—

*He sees the danger and bolts.*

**ariv (laughing):**  
ahh shit—she’s gonna kill me!

*Swasti chases after him, yelling threats, laughing in between. The valley echoes with their voices. Somewhere between hate and love.*


### [EXT. OUTSIDE GIRLS' DORM – NIGHTFALL]

They stop outside her dorm. It’s quiet. The soft hum of insects fills the silence. Swasti doesn’t say anything — too much happened today.

**ARIV**  
(softly)  
Bye. Don’t think too much. I said that in the heat of the moment.

Swasti finally breaks the silence. Her voice still carries a touch of anger — he did make her cry.

**SWASTI**  
Since when do you speak from emotion? Never seen that happen before.

Ariv scratches his temple, almost embarrassed.

**ARIV**  
Yeah well… now you have. You're the first witness.

**SWASTI**  
Don’t dodge the question. What were you implying back there? That I’m using you? You idiot.

**ARIV**  
I don’t know. It just came out. After that day… I don’t know what’s happening to me.  
(pauses)  
And you’re responsible for that.

**SWASTI**  
What did I do?

**ARIV**  
You made me a fool in love.

Swasti’s taken aback. She wasn’t expecting that. A tiny blush creeps up. She smiles.

**SWASTI**  
Well, Mr. Fool... don’t say that again, or I will break your legs.

**ARIV**  
Yeah yeah. My bad. I said something I shouldn’t’ve.

**SWASTI**  
Good. Glad you get it.

She starts walking toward the dorm gate. Then, without turning—

**SWASTI**  
By the way… I liked that sneak attack you did.  
Try that more often, and I won’t stay mad.

Ariv’s caught off guard. He blushes this time. She glances back and smiles. He waves her goodbye.

He watches her walk all the way inside. The dorm light flicks on behind the glass doors.  
His smile fades — slowly. He stares at the building a moment longer.

Then exhales.

**ARIV**  
(to himself, half-laughing)  
Girls really can get away with anything just by crying.  
Maybe I should try that too.  
Crying with a little begging? Hmm… could work.  
Yeah… needs more testing.

He turns away. Pulls out his phone. The softness in his face disappears — replaced by something colder.

**ARIV**  
(into phone)  
Hello?

**VIR**  
Yeah. What’s up?

**ARIV**  
Get ready. We’re doing it.

Vir’s tone immediately turns serious.

**VIR**  
Okay. I’ll start the prep.

**ARIV**  
Switching off my phone after this. Wait for my call.

**VIR**  
Hmm. Best of luck.

**ARIV**  
Yeah… same to you.

**VIR**  
We’re not doing birthday wishes, bro. What “same to you”?

**ARIV**  
What do you mean? People say “same to you” for birthday too.

**VIR**  
No bro, that’s for New Year wishes or stuff like that.

**ARIV**  
Tch. Stay away from DK. His effect is rubbing off on you.

**VIR**  
You might be right.  
(looks at DK)  
Hey DK, go sit on the other bench.

**DK**  
Huh? Why?

**VIR**  
Nothing. Just go.

*(DK moves. Confused.)*

**VIR**  
Yeah bro, he was too close. My IQ dropped a little.

**ARIV**  
Good. Keep your mind sharp. We can’t afford mistakes now.

**VIR**  
Yeah. Good luck.

**ARIV**  
Same to y—  
*(call cuts)*

**ARIV**  
Smart boy.

Back on the other end, Vir looks out at the pine trees.

**VIR**  
(sighs)  
What day has come that we’re counting on DK…

**DK**  
You said something?

**VIR**  
Nah. Carry on.

**DK**  
What the hell is wrong with him?
