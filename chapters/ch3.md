**She:** So what happened next? How far did you even go with her?

**He:** Nowhere, really. I never tend to get intimate with anyone.

She leans back into the chair, arms folding across her chest. One brow arches, slow and skeptical—like she’s scanning a glitch in a program.

**She:** So… she’s just like me. Just existing there.

**He:** Damn, that kinda stings when you put it like that.

He scratches his neck, eyes flicking away for a second, then back.

**She:** Well, it’s true. You never did anything with any of them. The childhood one ghosted you. The second was long distance—so, hands-off. And this one? You’re saying you didn’t even kiss?

**He:** Nope.

**She (mock gasps):** What a waste. And here I thought you could become a legendary playboy, charming girls into bed with just a smile. But no—turns out, you haven’t even kissed anyone. Are you sure you’re not… I dunno, impotent? Or maybe gay?

She leans in slightly with the last line, grin teasing but eyes sharp, watching his reaction closely.

**He (deadpan):** Okay, now you’re just being dramatic. I’m not gay. I… verified.

**She (leans forward, curious):** Verified? How?!

Her tone drops in pitch, less mocking now—genuinely intrigued. One leg swings slowly beneath the chair.

**He:** It's not what you're imagining. I just… wondered why I wasn’t feeling “that way” towards anyone. So one day, I watched some gay porn. Just to test. Turns out, nope—didn't like it. Actually messed me up for a few days. I couldn’t even watch regular stuff after that.

His voice is calm but a little self-conscious, like recounting a private science experiment gone wrong.

**She:** Hmm… interesting. Still, I think I need to verify this personally. I mean, imagine—we get married and find out you’re broken. No kids. Our families looking at us like we’re cursed.

Her words are light, but she doesn’t break eye contact. Joking, sure—but not *just* joking.

**He (half-laughing):** You might have a point. Maybe we should verify.

She smirks—he’s walked right into it. She sits up straighter, eyes glinting.

**She:** Great. Strip.

**He (blinks):** What?

**She (unfazed):** Let’s get this over with. Gotta check if the machinery’s functional.

She waves her hand like it’s an official request form, her tone dry but relentless.

**He:** Alright—wait, hold on. What the hell are you trying to do?

He leans back instinctively, posture stiffening.

**She:** Quality inspection. Standard procedure.

**He:** It works, okay? I checked it last night. Fully operational.

He lifts both hands like he’s surrendering to a police search.

She curses under her breath, mostly to herself, her plan slipping through her fingers.

**She:** Yeah, but I haven’t verified it.

She starts moving toward him, slow and deliberate.

**He:** Why do you need to verify it?

**She:** Because I’m your girlfriend. I have the right to know everything about you.

**He:** You won’t be my girlfriend for long. We’re literally talking about breaking up.

**She:** Yet. We're talking. Until then, I still have girlfriend privileges.

While she’s talking, she casually leans in, eyes fixed on his belt like a predator eyeing weak armor. Her fingers move subtly.

**He (startled):** Hey! No! I’m not mentally prepared for this!

He jerks backward with a speed that betrays panic, nearly toppling the chair. His foot bangs into the nearby table.

**She:** You’re acting like a maiden right now.

**He:** And you’re acting like a pervert out for my body!

**She (grinning):** Hmmm, yeah. Hahahaha!

**He (half out the door, mock yelling):** Someone save me from this predator!

---

She steps forward with casual menace, one brow raised like a villain in slow motion. Before he can react, she plants a palm on his chest and nudges him backward—playful, but firm.

The balcony door swings shut behind him. *Click.*

He turns around. The narrow balcony. The quiet street below. The last blush of daylight fading into navy.

He exhales. A tiny cloud in the evening air.

**He (muttering):** She wouldn’t actually try undressing me out here… would she?

His eyes flick back to the glass.

**He:** …Wait. She might.

He edges toward the door, eyes narrowing. She’s leaning just on the other side, framed in the soft yellow light of the room.

**He:** What do you want?

Her voice is quieter now, the playfulness dialed down, face unreadable behind the pane.

**She:** I want you.

His jaw clenches, just slightly.

**He:** Yeah… that’s not something I can give. Pick something else.

She doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t blink. Just lifts a finger and points down at his waist.

**She:** Then I want that.

**He:** That’s off-limits.

**She:** Then I’ll take it by force.

She gives a half-smile, but there’s an ache underneath it now, hard to name.

He stares back for a moment, then drops his act with a tired breath. He steps forward—no longer playing along, no longer dodging.

**She (raising a brow):** So… you’ve surrendered?

But he doesn’t answer.

His footsteps are soft, slow, like walking through fog. There’s no threat in his body. Just something stripped bare.

Her smirk fades. She moves aside, unlocking the door without a word. There’s no more chase left in her.

He crosses the threshold and wraps his arms around her. Firm. Quiet. Final.

She froze for half a second, not understanding… then melted into it without asking questions. Her cheek brushed his shoulder, breath catching for just a moment before settling. Her arms slid around him gently, like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Her cheek finds his shoulder. Her breath evens out against his neck.

**She (softly):** Don’t worry. Nothing’s gonna happen. And even if it does, we’ll face it together. I’m not letting go.

**He (murmuring):** I believe you. Just… don’t leave me like the others.

**She:** That’s not happening. You’re stuck with me now. Like a leech.

He chuckles, low and warm, fingers tightening slightly on her spine.

---

Later, they returned to the room, the night quieter now—like even time had slowed down to watch them.

She sat over him, sideways on the chair, legs curled gently, body relaxed. He pulled her in close, arms around her like instinct—like they’d always belonged there. It was their first time being this physically close: skin brushing, breaths syncing, her hair occasionally tickling his face in the soft breeze drifting in from the open window.

No words. Just that stillness. That hush. That fragile kind of closeness neither of them dared to break.


Her perfume—soft and floral—mixed with something uniquely her. It grounded him, and sent his thoughts into a haze he didn’t fully understand yet.

She smiled faintly, watching him absentmindedly play with the strands of her hair as he spoke. That smile… it sent a flutter through him.

**He (softly):** “So yeah, just like that… we began dating. She proposed, we met often at college. Nothing felt drastically different for me, but for her… everything shifted. She looked at me more often, smiled more. We started sharing lunch under a tree—simple meals, split in halves. My sister would show up sometimes, and we’d act like nothing was going on. But I think she had a hunch. She knew her friend was acting different.”

She nodded, listening quietly, arms draped lazily over his shoulders. Her thumb brushed lightly against his collarbone, as if on autopilot.

**He (continuing):** “After class, we’d go to the park nearby—me, her, and my sister. It became our routine. Everything was just… calm. Sometimes, we’d see couples kissing—playing with their mouths.”

**She (grinning):** “Wait. *Playing with mouths*? What even is that?”

**He (mock shocked):** “You’re surprisingly innocent, especially after what you tried earlier.”

She turned her head, puzzled. Their faces were just inches apart now.

He reached up and touched her lips, a light press of his fingers, as if sketching the word he was about to say.

**He:** “It’s a French kiss. No hands involved. Just two people digging for treasure in each other’s mouths.”

**She (gagging playfully):** “Yuck! What the hell is that description? I feel like throwing up now.”

**He (nodding):** “Exactly the feeling I get when people talk about kissing.”

**She:** “You make it sound like a health hazard.”

**He (grinning like a mad scientist):** “It *is*! A germ-sharing ritual.”

She smirked—a slow, dangerous one.

He noticed. But too late.

“Before he could piece it together, she was already moving—slipping into his lap like it was the most natural thing in the world.”

He froze.

Tried to think, to say something clever—but his brain short-circuited. And just like that, all defenses dropped.

They kissed.

Slowly at first, then deeper—tongues meeting not in battle, but in exploration. He let instinct take over for the first time, and she met it halfway. Warm. Hungry. Gentle. Wild.

When they finally pulled apart, she was grinning.

**She:** “Hmm… I can now confirm, your machine isn’t faulty.”

He blinked, still dazed.

**She (with a wicked smile):** “I also feel something rising… and it’s definitely not the Shield Hero.”

He groaned, throwing his head back.

**He:** “Another soldier lost… without even drawing a sword.”

She leaned in, resting her forehead against his.

**She (softly):** “Don’t worry. I’ll heal you after battle.”

She pulled back just enough to see his face, her tone shifting from playful to curious.

**She:**  
"So… how was it? Your first kiss?"

He looked at her for a moment—quiet, blinking slowly, as if trying to hold onto the feeling a little longer.

**He:**  
"I don't even have the words. But I will say this—fuck those scientists and doctors who said kissing is unhygienic and unhealthy. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever felt. Honestly, I think they just never got to experience it themselves, so they decided to slander it. And like an idiot, I believed them."

**She (laughing):**  
"You really let it all out, huh? Well then, from now on, kiss me more often. I'm not taking the lead every single time."

**He (a bit shy):**  
"Yes, my lady… as you wish."

**She (smiling warmly):**  
"I'm glad you never gave it to anyone else. Thank them, actually, for not stealing it from me. I’m the one who got to have your first time… that’s something special."

(She leans in a little closer, her voice lower now, eyes searching his face. The smile fades slightly.)

Her eyes lingered on his lips for a beat longer than necessary. When she finally spoke, her voice was softer, more careful—like she was walking on something fragile.

**She:**  
"So…  Why did you two break up?"

**He** (quietly, eyes dropping to his lap):  
"It was because of her. I kept telling her to focus on her studies, not lose sight of what matters… but after she proposed, it was like nothing else existed for her anymore. She stopped paying attention in class, kept daydreaming, glancing at me instead of at the board, always planning our next park visit or movie night instead of prepping for exams."

(He exhales a soft, frustrated sigh, fingers unconsciously tightening around hers.)

**He** (continuing, the weight of the memory in his voice):  
"Then board exams hit. I passed with good grades… she failed. I tried to push her, to motivate her, helped her prepare for the compartment exam—but she failed again. Eventually… her father had enough. He got her married off."

(He looks down, hands clasped tightly, a bitter smile tugging at his lips, trying to keep the walls up but failing. She watches him closely, her fingers gently tracing the edge of his palm.)

**He** (half-laughing bitterly):  
"I think I’m cursed. Everyone who falls in love with me ends up married… just not to me."

(She stays quiet for a moment, her fingers now weaving through his. Her smile is teasing, but there’s a hint of sadness in her eyes.)

**She** (with a soft, teasing smile):  
"Let’s see… your school crush ghosted you. The long-distance one got married. Now your college sweetheart too… Maybe it's my turn now?"

**He** (staring at her in mock horror, but the humor doesn’t quite reach his eyes):  
"And that’s exactly why I told you we should break up. I don’t want to watch it happen again. I can't go through that again."

(She leans back slightly on his lap, her back resting against his legs. She gently plays with his fingers, her thumb grazing his knuckles. Her voice lowers, the mood shifting from playful to something softer, more contemplative.)

**She** (quietly, her tone grounded, almost like a quiet confession):  
"You know… sometimes I wonder if people like us are meant to last. Not because there’s something wrong between us… but because the world just doesn’t seem to allow it."

**He** (eyes flickering to the floor, the weight of her words settling on him, his chest tight):  
"Yeah. It’s like… every time I feel something real, it slips through my fingers. I hold on tight, but the world just finds a way to take it away."

(She shifts slightly, lifting her chin to meet his gaze. Her eyes are steady, not full of pity, but with a quiet strength he can’t ignore.)

**She** (softly, with a knowing look):  
"And still, you keep trying. Even when you told me to break up, I knew you didn’t want that… not really."

**He** (his voice softens, a sigh escaping as he tries to push down the flood of emotions rising in him):  
"It’s not about wanting. It’s about preparing. If history repeats, then what’s the point of getting attached to something I might lose again?"

(She sits up straighter now, moving her hand to his cheek, her thumb tracing the line of his jaw. Her gaze sharpens, yet there’s an unspoken tenderness in the way she holds him, as though she’s holding him not just physically, but emotionally.)

**She** (softly, with conviction, her voice calm but fierce):  
"But what if this time, history needs rewriting?"

**He** (sighing, his voice barely a whisper, as though he’s speaking to himself more than her):  
"That’s easy to say now. But time… time wears everything down. One day it’s distance. The next, it’s circumstances. Family. Careers. Expectations. You never know what hits you next."

(She leans in, her forehead resting against his, her breath warm against his skin. For a moment, they’re just two people, together in silence, holding onto each other in a way neither of them had expected.)

**She** (her voice barely audible, but filled with an unexpected certainty):  
"And what if we get hit… and we don’t break?"

(He pulls back just enough to look at her, surprised by her words. She’s not smiling now, her expression serious, grounded in a way he hasn’t seen before. She’s no longer just playing at this. She’s in it.)

**He** (his voice thick with emotion, his gaze searching hers, as if trying to understand what she means):  
"You really believe that?"

(She doesn’t hesitate. Her eyes never leave his, her hands still on him, strong and warm. She leans in a fraction closer, her breath mingling with his.)

**She** (softly, her words like a promise):  
"I don’t believe it. I choose it. There’s a difference."

(They both fall into silence, the weight of what she’s said hanging in the air between them. The breeze picks up again, brushing her hair over her face. He closes his eyes briefly, as if to steady himself, and she gently brushes the strands away with a tender touch.)

**She** (with a small, playful laugh, the moment lightening for a heartbeat):  
"You think I’m scared of a little bad luck? C’mon… I’ve already kissed you. That’s like signing a contract with fate."

**He** (half-smiling, a quiet chuckle escaping, his gaze soft but still serious):  
"Then we’re both doomed."

**She** (grinning, her eyes sparkling with mischief):  
"Then we’ll be doomed together."

(There’s a pause—a beat of shared laughter, then the room quiets again. The heaviness of the conversation doesn’t feel like a burden anymore. It feels like a shared understanding, a connection that’s anchored them both.)

**He** (softly, his voice almost reverent as he looks at her):  
"You really mean it, don’t you?"

**She** (nodding, her forehead still resting gently against his, her eyes closing for a moment):  
"Every word. I’m not running. Not now. Not ever."

(He lifts his hand, brushing the side of her face with the back of his fingers, his touch light but intentional. His thumb traces the curve of her lips, as if memorizing the feel of her.)

**He** (barely audible, his voice thick with emotion):  
"I never thought someone would stay."

(She smiles at that, a warmth in her expression that makes his heart flutter.)

**She** (smiling, a little teasing, a little tender):  
"Then I’ll just have to keep proving you wrong."

(She leans in, and this time the kiss is different. It’s slower, softer, deeper. No rush, no hesitation—just a silent promise. His hands hold her like she’s fragile, but also like she’s the most important thing in his world. Her fingers tangle in his hair, pulling him closer, her heart pounding against his chest as their lips meet in a kiss that feels like everything and nothing at once.)

(When they finally part, their breaths are still tangled together, and she lingers just a heartbeat more, her hand on his chest before slowly pulling away. She rises from his lap, her movements slow, like she’s leaving something precious behind.)

**She** (with a teasing grin, fixing her hair as she heads to the door):  
"I should go. My roommate's already suspicious… and if she finds out I’m not in the dorm, she’ll think I’m out committing war crimes."

**He** (half-laughing, his voice still thick with emotion):  
"Tell her you were. Emotionally."

**She** (grinning as she opens the door, her gaze softening as she looks back):  
"Only on you."

(She pauses in the doorway, looking back one last time, her eyes softer than ever before. For a moment, she’s not just teasing—she’s vulnerable, and it makes his chest ache.)

**She** (her voice low, like she’s sharing something intimate):  
"Don’t overthink tonight, okay? Just… hold onto how it felt."

**He** (nodding, his eyes locked on her):  
"I will. Promise."

**She** (with a wink, her voice carrying a lightheartedness that contrasts with the depth of the moment):  
"And maybe next time, you take the lead."

And with that, she slips out of the room, her presence lingering in the air like the soft scent of her perfume. He watches the door for a long moment, still reeling, before leaning back in his chair. He closes his eyes, his heart racing, his mind swirling with a thousand thoughts. But there’s something in him, something hopeful, that wasn’t there before.
