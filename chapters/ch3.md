INT. LIVING ROOM – MORNING

Fade in from black. A soft hum of wind weaves through the open window. The room is bathed in the golden hue of late morning sunlight—beams slicing through dusty air, falling over the quiet chaos of a lived-in space.

It's Sunday.
The sun is already high in the sky, casting its warmth on the sleepy world below. Inside the dim room, Vir, Ariv, and DK are sprawled across couches and mattresses like fallen warriors after battle. Blankets tangled, limbs stretched out in dramatic disarray. They sleep like corpses — peaceful, heavy, and unaware.

A gust of wind slams the loose window shut.
CLACK.

The sharp sound echoes through the silent room.

Vir stirs.
He groans softly, eyes fluttering open. His vision blurs into focus as he turns toward the wall clock — 11:30. He sighs and sits up slowly, his hair messy, eyes puffy, the kind of face that tells stories of last night’s chaos.

His gaze falls on his sleeping brothers-in-arms.
Something sparks behind his eyes. A tiny smirk blooms.

He carefully lifts DK's hand and drapes it over his own shoulder.
Then, shifts DK’s leg and lays it provocatively over Ariv’s back.

With the gentlest effort, he lifts a half-sleeping Ariv and drops him onto DK’s lap.

A tableau of pure scandal.

He steps back — like a sculptor admiring his masterpiece.
Click.
He snaps a photo.
The grin doesn’t leave his face.

Cut to:
INT. BATHROOM – CONTINUOUS

Vir stands at the sink, hands on the edges, staring into the mirror.
There’s a dark circle beneath the eye — not dramatic, but enough to show.

He studies his reflection like it’s someone else. The wind whispers through the window again. His fingers twitch, then he turns on the tap and splashes water over his face — like washing away a mask, or wiping the slate clean.

Back to the living room.
The place is unusually clean today.
No empty bottles. No chaos. Just… stillness.

Vir steps toward the small table, sits quietly, picks a cigarette from a crumpled pack.
He lights it with a practiced flick.
Drag.
Exhales slowly, eyes drifting toward the window.

Wide shot: A mountain view.
Peaceful. Trees dancing. A bird’s nest rests just outside the window.
Tiny hatchlings chirp, their beaks wide open. The mother bird returns, dropping food into each mouth.

Vir watches, flicking the ash gently into the tray.
There’s a quiet sadness in his gaze.

The laptop screen glows.
He leans over, types something. Checks something else. Then stares again.

Ariv stirs behind him — already awake for a while.
He’s watching Vir, silently.
There’s a calm to him, a kind of amused curiosity, like he’s watching someone else’s movie.

Ariv (softly):
“You look quite sophisticated right now.”

Vir flinches slightly, twisting around. He hadn’t noticed anyone awake.
He stares at Ariv, caught off guard.

Ariv:
“No need to feel shy, we’re both men here.”

He glances over at DK — limbs still flopped in offensive positions.

Ariv (grinning):
“Ah… I don’t know about him though.”

He yawns, stretches, reaches for his phone.

Sudden panic.
30+ messages. 10+ missed calls. All from Swasti.

Ariv (under breath):
“Shit.”

He starts reading.
His face morphs through emotions like a TikTok filter: panic, regret, confusion, dread.

Vir watches, amused.
A chuckle slips from him.

Vir (teasing):
“Ah... young love.”

Ariv gets up and bolts toward the bathroom.
Vir, finishing his smoke, walks over to the bed.

His shadow looms over DK.
A mischievous grin curls at the corners of his mouth.

Vir (mocking whisper):
“You were acting high and mighty last night, huh? Let’s see... what should I do with you?”

Ariv exits the bathroom, mid-step, and freezes.
The scene looks straight out of a horror movie.

Ariv (whispers):
“Well... DK is fucked. He really teased him a lot yesterday.”

Vir glances at him.

Ariv (hands raised):
“I don’t know anything. I didn’t see anything. You can carry on.”

Vir’s smile turns creepy.
Not a friendly one. A “you messed with the wrong guy” kind of smile.

Ariv backs away, grabs a cig, and perches on the chair like an innocent bystander.

Vir plunges his hand under the mattress — with surprising strength, he yanks it, flipping DK’s limp body like a pancake.

DK (half-screaming):
“Who the fuck did that?!”

He sees Vir. Then Ariv.

Ariv shrugs, gesturing like “I warned you.”

DK:
“Hey, we can talk! No need for viol—”
Pillow.
Whap. Right in the face.

DK (muffled):
“Ah! Hey! Stop! We can talk! Not the face, man!”

Ariv is laughing now. This is peak entertainment.

DK:
“Why are you laughing?! Help me, damn it!”

Vir turns to Ariv.

Ariv (deadpan):
“I’m not moving from here. You’re on your own.”

Vir stops hitting.
DK breathes in relief — maybe the nightmare is over.

DK:
“Thank God... what’s wrong with you? Senile already? Hitting me first thing in the morning—”

Vir (calm but commanding):
“Get up and start doing the dishes.”

DK (blinking):
“…Huh?”

Vir (a little louder):
“Did you hear me or not? Or should I really get serious?”

DK gets up like a school kid being sent to detention.
Grumbling. Groaning. But moving.

He drags his feet toward the kitchen.

Vir exhales.
Long. Deep. Satisfying.

He walks back to the window, staring outside — the birds still chirping, the wind still whispering, the world carrying on as if nothing happened.

Fade out.

### **INT. LIVING ROOM – LATER THAT AFTERNOON**

The sun has shifted its position, casting mellow golden light that filters through the worn-out curtains, painting soft patterns on the floor. Dust floats lazily in the air like snow suspended in time. The room is calm now, like the calm after a storm—only the distant chirps of birds and the low hum of the ceiling fan fill the silence.

Ariv is hunched over the laptop at the dining table, a soft frown creasing his forehead as the light from the screen reflects off his glasses. He scrolls slowly, fingers occasionally pausing, as if measuring the weight of each line he reads. Vir sits cross-legged on the floor across from him, clutching a pillow like armor, his posture slouched, eyes half-lidded from lack of sleep. The dark circles under his eyes look even more prominent in the soft sunlight. DK is tiptoeing around like a restless cat, sipping something warm from a chipped mug, occasionally peeking over Ariv’s shoulder to annoy him.

**Ariv** *(without looking up)*:\
So… have you reviewed it yet?

**Vir** *(rubbing his eye, voice still rough from sleep)*:\
No. There’s still a large chunk missing. But I’m gonna sort what we do have—piece by piece.

**DK** *(flops onto the couch dramatically, one arm over his forehead)*:\
Well, what did you expect? Rome wasn’t burned in one night.

**Vir** *(raising an eyebrow)*:\
You mean "built"?

**DK** *(points a lazy finger at him, dead serious)*:\
Nah. I meant what I said.

Ariv snorts, a quiet laugh escaping before he catches himself. He leans back slightly and stretches, a few soft cracks from his spine. His eyes wander to the window—the sky outside is soft blue, clouds moving slowly like they're in no rush to be anywhere.

**Ariv** *(calmly)*:\
No need to rush. I still have some time left.

His voice trails off like a drifting thought. Vir and DK both pause for a moment, exchange a subtle glance, and then simply nod in quiet agreement.

**Vir** *(dryly)*:\
Mhm. Time... the one luxury we never had, but somehow always abuse.

**DK** *(leaning forward, squinting)*:\
Hey, one thing’s been bugging me—how the hell did you get access to the college server? I’ve tried cracking that before and failed.

Ariv looks up at him with an amused smile, a hint of mockery dancing in his eyes.

**DK** *(frowning)*:\
Don’t smile. Your teeth look yellow.

**Ariv** *(smirking)*:\
Just say you're jealous.

**DK** *(defensive)*:\
I’m not.

**Ariv** *(tilts head, with mock sincerity)*:\
It’s a long story. I’ll tell you some other day.

**DK** *(groaning dramatically, throwing his head back)*:\
You see that? Now he’s hiding things from us.

**Vir** *(nodding along, equally dramatic)*:\
Tragic. We’ve lost him to the dark side.

**Ariv** *(grinning)*:\
I’m not hiding anything. I’m just... not in the mood.

**Vir** *(leaning slightly forward, studying Ariv)*:\
So... how was he?

**Ariv** *(pausing, then softly)*:\
More than what he shows.

**Vir** *(brows furrowed)*:\
Hmm. It’ll be difficult then.

**Ariv** *(quietly, resolute)*:\
Yeah. Difficult, but not impossible.

Vir watches him for a beat longer, like trying to read something unspoken in his face.

**Vir**:\
You used to say that before, too... So, are you sure about her?

DK, who was aimlessly stirring his drink with his finger, perks up slightly, curious.

**Ariv** *(leaning back in the chair, looking up at the ceiling)*:\
Back then, I was just a spectator. I watched as they were snatched away, right in front of me. And I did nothing.

**DK** *(without sarcasm for once)*:\
What could you have even done? Fight their parents? Beg them not to marry her off?

Ariv turns to him, eyes twinkling like he’s halfway between joking and dead serious.

**Ariv**:\
Yeah. I thought about that yesterday... Maybe cry while begging. More effective that way.

DK bursts into laughter. Vir chuckles and reaches out, gently patting Ariv’s head.

**Vir** *(mock warning)*:\
You should keep your distance from him. His influence is clearly spreading.

**DK** *(feigning offense)*:\
Hey, what do you mean by that?

The room fills with laughter. The tension breaks like ice melting. Vir picks up the cigarette pack from the table, only two left. He lights one and silently offers the other to Ariv, who accepts it.

The flame from the lighter flickers against Ariv's face. He takes a drag, eyes narrowing as he inhales. A few quiet moments pass. They sit in silence—three friends, worn out, stretched thin, but still here.

Ariv exhales the smoke slowly, gesturing with the cigarette toward the window.

**Ariv** *(calm, unwavering)*:\
I’ve made up my mind. This time... I’ll write my own fate. Let’s see who has the power to snatch her away from me.

Vir and DK both look at him. For a moment, there’s no smirking, no teasing. Just quiet pride—and maybe even a bit of awe.

They smile.

**FADE OUT.**

The room is basked in a warm amber glow, the sun slowly descending behind the mountains. Dust particles float lazily in the golden beams. A soft breeze wafts in through the half-open window, ruffling the curtain ever so slightly.

Ariv sits cross-legged on the rug, back against the sofa, lazily scrolling through his phone. The screen's reflection glints in his eyes—but then, something shifts. His body tenses. Just slightly. Like a shiver brushing past the spine.

He freezes. His thumb hovering mid-air. His expression morphs from casual to deeply alert—like prey sensing a predator before the growl.

DK (sipping from his cup, watching him with mild curiosity):
What happened? It's like a snake just crawled over you.

Vir (sits back on his elbows, puffing smoke toward the ceiling, eyes narrowed):
...what now?

Ariv (barely above a whisper):
She called me.
He swipes. Swipes again.
More than ten times. And… she’s sent a whole essay worth of messages.
He slumps slightly, rubbing his forehead.
Ah, I am so fucked.

DK (snorts):
Yeah. You’re seriously fucked right now.

Vir (without breaking eye contact with the drifting clouds):
Every day’s a funeral, huh.

Ariv dials the number. The ringing starts. His legs bounce in place out of nervous habit. DK leans in, nosy.

Ariv:
She's not picking up.

DK (mock-concerned):
Maybe she’s been kidnapped.

Ariv (shoots a glare so sharp it could cut glass)

The call connects.

Ariv (suddenly alert):
Hello?
Hello, you there?

He strains to hear. The background hum of traffic filters through.

Ariv:
I can hear car sounds… If you're not in the mood to talk, that’s okay. I’ll cut the call—

Swasti (voice cuts in like thunder):
So you still have the guts to call?

Ariv (eyes widening):
I was sleeping…

Swasti (flatly):
Who sleeps this late?

Ariv glances around the room. DK does a mocking halo pose. Vir stifles a laugh.

Ariv (casually):
We all three.

Swasti:
Oh. I thought you were dead.

Ariv (grinning):
We recently came into a relationship and you already want me dead?

A pause. A thick one.

Swasti (with a sigh):
There’s no point arguing with you.
Where are you right now?

Ariv:
The usual.

Swasti:
I’m coming. We need to talk.

Ariv (eyebrows lifting):
Oh, okay.
By the way… where are you right now?

Swasti (calmly):
Near the turn.

Ariv (instantly):
Good. Get me a pack of cigs.

Swasti (irritated):
Don’t smoke that much. You’ll die of cancer.

Ariv (pretending to be moved):
You really are hellbent on killing me now.
And people who smoke don’t die of cancer.

Swasti (already done with him):
Then how do they die?

Ariv (cheerfully morbid):
They die from heart attacks.

Swasti (snaps):
If you already know that, why are you still asking?!

Ariv (mock tragic):
Well, what’s the point of living when my life’s already fucked?
My girlfriend is like a demon—I mean, angry all the time.
Might as well aim for peace in the afterlife.

A silence. A dangerous one. Even the breeze seems to pause.

Swasti (low, cold):
Who are you calling demon?
Don’t think I didn’t hear that.
And how the fuck do you expect to go to heaven?

Ariv (smirking, defiant):
I don’t want to go where you’ll be present.
I want peace, at least after my death.

The anger radiates from the phone like static. DK instinctively takes a step back. Vir slowly puts his cigarette down.

Swasti (gritted teeth):
Just you wait… I’m coming.

Ariv (cheerfully unfazed):
Don’t forget the cigs.

Click. The call ends. The silence returns like a tide.

Vir stands up with a slow exhale, brushing ash off his pants.

Vir (to DK, calm but firm):
It's better we leave.

DK (already grabbing his slippers):
Yeah… he poked the hornet's nest.
I don’t want to get stung.
