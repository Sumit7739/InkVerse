[INT. ROOM — DAY]

The phone rings.

He (picking up): Hello?

She (direct, playful): Where are you?

He: Same old cave — the usual.

She: Try crawling out of that turtle shell you call a room, will you?

He (dry chuckle): You do realize a turtle can’t come out of its shell, right?

She: Idiot. Anyway, I’m coming over.

He: Why?

She: I just... wanted to see you.

He: And why would you want to do that?

She: I don’t know. Just felt like it.

He: Huh. Where are you right now?

She: Near the convenience store.

He: Great. Grab me a pack of smokes.

She: Mhm. Anything else, your highness?

He: Yeah, my lighter’s dead. Get one of those too.

She: Noted.

He: And get something for yourself while you’re at it. My treat.

She (mock-surprised): Oh wow, someone’s feeling generous today. What’s the occasion?

He (softly): You’ll know in a while.

[INT. HIS ROOM — LATER]

She opens the door.

He’s seated on a chair, book in hand, glasses slipped slightly down his nose. Behind him, a cluttered desk — half chaos, half sanctuary — with books stacked like a scholar's wall and a laptop glowing softly. A single chair faces him, and behind that, a large window opens to the mountains. A bird's nest sways gently in a tree just beyond the glass. Peace lives here.

She walks in without knocking — like always — and casually tosses the cigarette pack and lighter onto the desk.

She settles into the chair across from him.

Without a word, he gets up and walks into the kitchen.

She (calling out): So… what’s the occasion?

He (from the kitchen): Thinking of breaking up.

The air stills for a second.

She blinks, visibly caught off guard, but quickly steadies herself.

She: And… what brought that brilliant idea?

He (stirring coffee): A cocktail of thoughts. But for simplicity’s sake… we just don’t work.

She (quietly): So you’re saying I’m not good for you?

He sighs, knowing exactly where this is headed.

He: No, my lady. It’s the opposite. You’re the noble princess in a crystal tower, and I’m the guy milking sheep in the valley. Society wouldn’t root for this genre of love story.

She knows he’s joking. Barely. The smile she offers is thin.

She: I don’t care about society.

He: Well, I do. Society gives us jobs, money, overpriced WiFi, and bread. Unless, of course, you’re up for farming? I could teach you how to dig potatoes.

She rolls her eyes but doesn’t smile.

She: Stop dodging and talk. What actually happened? Did someone say something?

He: Someone did say something. (pauses) By the way—how much sugar? You still on that anti-sweetness diet?

She: No sugar. You’ve already made the day bitter enough.

He winces at her tone but nods, beginning to pour the coffee.

She: So? What did this mysterious “someone” say?

He: They told me to look in the mirror.

She: And?

He: They said, “She looks like milk and moonlight, like an angel on vacation from heaven. You, my friend, look like charcoal that lost the will to burn.”

She bursts into laughter, shaking her head.

She: That’s what made you spiral? Seriously?

He walks over and hands her the coffee.

She (still laughing): Okay fine, add some sugar now.

He: Nope. Drink it like this.

She (blinks): Why?

He (softly): You’ll need it. Trust me.

She stops laughing. The silence that follows feels heavy — not empty.

She stares at him, the coffee untouched in her hand.

---

Silence settles like fog. They sit across from each other, sipping coffee in an atmosphere thick with unspoken things. Their eyes lock occasionally, then dart away. His stare is analytical—curious, searching. Hers is softer, tinted with sadness, confusion. Two people in the same room, but orbiting different thoughts.

She (grimacing): How the hell do you drink this bitter crap? It’s like my taste buds just signed a resignation letter.

He (smirking): Funny. You were chugging it like it was ancestral nectar just yesterday.

She: Exactly my point. What changed overnight?

He catches the weight of her words. His smirk fades. He pauses, stirs his coffee slowly, thinking.

He: The heart… is fickle. It flips like a switch sometimes.

She (quietly, firmly): I didn’t think your heart was like that. Would you stop dodging already and just—be honest with me?

He looks up at her, eyes a little darker now.

He: How much do you even know me?

She (after a beat): Not much. You never really shared anything.

He (raising an eyebrow): You never asked.

She: Oh please. Then let me ask you—how much do you know about me?

He: Almost everything.

She blinks. He continues, casually, but there’s an edge under it.

He: Your childhood stories, your extended family tree, the mole on your back you think no one noticed, your love for mangoes but hate for mango-flavored anything, the way your voice drops when you’re sad, and lifts ever so slightly when you're faking a smile. I’ve paid attention.

She looks at him, caught somewhere between disbelief and realization.

She (softly): Then… what’s the problem?

He (eyes locked on her): I don’t know. Maybe that’s the problem—I never felt anything from you. Not truly.

She looks down. That one stings.

She (whispers): Then why were we even in this… for a year?

He leans back slightly, staring at the now-empty mug in his hand.

He: Because I thought maybe… you understood me. Better than anyone else did. You read between the lines. You knew what I was thinking without me having to say it. Maybe that’s why I stayed. Wishful thinking, probably.

He places the mug down gently.

He (continuing): But it felt more like I was holding onto something that wasn’t real. A mirage. And I don’t want to drag you into a one-sided story. You deserve more than that.

She doesn't respond. Instead, she finishes the last sip of her coffee, the bitterness now blending with the silence around her.

She turns her gaze toward the window — where the mountains loom like quiet witnesses and the little bird’s nest sways gently in the tree.

He watches her. Studies her. Trying to decode her silence. Looking for answers in the curve of her brow, the twitch in her lip, the tight grip on the coffee mug.

She smirks, leaning forward just a bit.
She (teasingly): So... have you ever felt it before? You know — that stupid little thing called love?

He raises an eyebrow but doesn’t smile.
He: Yeah. I did. Once.

She perks up slightly, her eyes sharpening.
She: Oh? Do tell. You've never really shared stuff like that with me. I always thought you’d feel awkward if I pried too much into your past.

He: You had full permission to pry. You still do. I would've told you anything, everything — gladly. But you never asked.
(pauses, a hint of a smile)
I appreciate that, by the way. The way you respected my space. But maybe... that’s part of the reason we’re sitting here like this now.

She rolls her eyes, half amused.
She: You’re acting like a kid now.

He leans back in his chair, hands behind his head.
He: I am a kid in an adult’s body. My heart still has that childlike innocence.

She (sarcastically): Oh yeah? That “innocence” — where was it when you made that girl’s life hell? Turned her into a social outcast? Gave her enough trauma to leave the university?

He chuckles darkly.
He: Damn, you’re really something.
(pauses)
As for her... I can’t stand people who try to defame you. The kid in my heart told me to ruin her — and then promptly went on vacation.

She shakes her head, smirking despite herself.
She: Psychopath with morals.
(leans in again)
Alright then, Romeo — tell me about this sweetheart of yours.

He takes a deep breath, voice softening, the memory pulling at him.
He: It was during school. There was this girl in my class. I was painfully shy back then — barely looked people in the eye.
(pauses)
She lived a block away. Sometimes we’d bump into each other on the walk to school. I never had the guts to talk to her first. But… I think she noticed that.
She started initiating things — casual, harmless. Eventually, she’d hold my hand during those walks. And I’d just… follow. Eyes glued to the ground, heartbeat in my throat.

His tone turns dreamy for a second, then playful.
He: I swear, whenever she was around, the world would blur out. Like someone turned off the background noise — and it was just her.

She cuts in abruptly, eyebrow raised.
She: You do realize you’re talking about another girl in front of your current girlfriend? And you're way too happy reminiscing about it.

He snaps out of it, immediately shifting tone — a little flustered now.
He: What I meant was… I never felt that way again. Not until…
(pauses)
Well. During our farewell, she suddenly asked me, "Do you like me?"
I nodded like a dumbass. She smiled and just said, "Yeah… I figured."
That was it.
No confession. No drama. No promises.
We both walked away. Never spoke again.

She crosses her arms, tilting her head with a mock-serious look.
She: So… if you liked her that much, why didn’t you go after her?

He shrugs, eyes dropping for a moment.
He: I lacked the courage back then. What if she had rejected me? That what if was enough to stop me.

She raises an eyebrow, half-surprised.
She: You — not going after something you wanted? That’s… news to me.

He smiles faintly.
He: Yeah, I was like that. Quiet. Awkward.
College and university changed that. I started shaping my character, learning to stand firm — slowly became this version of me.

She smirks.
She: Huh. Still hard to believe you were that guy — all timid and unsure. What a revelation.

He groans.
He: Don’t make fun of me.

She throws her hands up in mock innocence, trying not to laugh.
She (ironically): I’m not making fun. I’m just trying to understand.
(smirking hard)

He narrows his eyes.
He: Yeah? Your face says otherwise.

She tries to keep a straight face, fails miserably, and bursts out laughing.
She: Okay, okay — sorry! I couldn’t help it.

He stands up, grabs both coffee mugs, and heads to the kitchen without a word.

She calls after him, still grinning.
She: Don’t be mad!

He, from the kitchen: I’m not mad.

He walks back in, brushing his hands casually on his pants, settling into his seat again. She watches him, playful but with a glint of curiosity.

She: So…
(squints dramatically)
Do you still remember her? Or are you planning to elope with her or something?

He looks at her — calm, unreadable.

She, watching his silence, voice sharper now:
Well, I thought maybe you had a change of heart. Maybe now you want to chase her again and just… shift me aside. So I don’t come in the way.

He exhales softly, maintaining eye contact.
He: It’s not like that.
It’s been more than ten years since we last talked. She’s a ghost from a life I’ve long buried. I don’t want anything with her.

She, frustration slowly bubbling up:
Then why the fuck do you want to break up?
Tell me — explain it to me.
And don’t give me that crap about me “not wanting to know you.” That’s bullshit.
I just didn’t want to rush things.
We still have a year before graduation — and a whole life beyond that.
I thought I’d get to know you… slowly. When you were ready to open up.

He stares at her, visibly struggling — like the weight of years pressing on his chest. The coffee has gone cold. The silence stretches.

He: Haa…
(sighs, finally)
So you really want to know?

She leans in, staring hard, voice dropping:
Yes.
Tell me honestly.
Wait…
(squints again, mock suspicious)
Are you… impotent?
Is that why you’ve never tried to get intimate with me? Hmm?

A beat. He blinks. That caught him off guard.

He, deadpan:
Wow. Straight to the point, huh?

She, arms crossed, eyes challenging but lips twitching from holding back a smirk:
I mean — just covering all angles. I am a thorough woman.

He chuckles dryly, rubbing his temples:
No. I’m not impotent.
If anything, I’m over-functional. I just… don’t want to be intimate with someone I’m unsure about.

She, softly now:
Unsure about me?

He:
No… unsure about myself.
What I feel.
What I want.
What I need.
If I’m being honest, I’ve always been a little broken inside.
Sometimes I think I was never built for love — just… observation. Strategy. Quiet detachment.
I tried with you because you were the first person who saw through the fog a little.
But somewhere deep inside, I think I knew… I’d end up hurting you eventually.

She: Okay wait—
If you really want me to know you, then tell me—
Did you have any other relationships? After her?
Maybe in college or university?

He, already sensing where this is going, mumbles:
Here we go again…

He: Yes. I had two.

She, narrowing her eyes like a detective solving a murder:
Two??
So you were a playboy from the start.
Playing with girls' feelings and tossing them aside when you were done.
Wow. What a revelation.

He, half-laughing but wounded:
Hey. That hurts. I’m not like that.

She, voice rising, eyes wide:
Then what’s happening right now?
Tell me — how long did those last, huh?

He, quietly:
A year. Maybe a little more.

She, throwing her hands up like she's in a drama:
I knew it!
You’re a classic use-and-throw guy!
God, how did I fall for someone like you?
What did I even see in you?
Ugh — someone kill me.
Wait, no. Don’t kill me.
But beat him. Beat this playboy thoroughly. Right here.

He, eyes wide, holding in a laugh:
Would you calm down and stop auditioning for a soap opera?

She, dramatically pointing at him while looking at the invisible crowd:
Someone save me from this pervert!
Wait…
(pauses, thinking)
He never even touched me like that…

(returns to normal tone, blinking)
Wait, yeah. You never did.

He, arms crossed:
Are you done?

She, sheepish grin:
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
I went a little overboard.

He:
A little?
You just called me a playboy and a pervert.

She, trying to deflect:
I didn’t mean it like that…

He:
Oh? Then what way did you mean it?

She, laughing and swatting the air:
Ugh, stop it. Don’t say it again.
Fine, fine. Tell me about your past "romance."

He, tone softening:
It wasn’t romance. It was… tragedy.

She, eyes widening again:
Oh god. Tragedy?
Wait—
Did you get them pregnant or something?

He stares at her blankly.

She, raising her hands like a surrendering soldier:
Okay okay! I won’t say anything now.
Go on. Talk.

He, sighing, leans back in his seat, gathering his thoughts.

She, under her breath, smirking:
Go on, you pervert playboy…

He, instantly:
That’s it!

He shoots her a glare, and she bursts out laughing, nearly choking on her breath.

He:
You want to hear it or not?

She:
Okay okay okay!
(mock zipping her lips)
Mmm-hmm. I’m listening.

He, half-smiling despite himself, begins:
He (gathering his thoughts):
“So, it was when I was in 9th. One day I just didn’t feel like going to school… so I went to the railway station instead.”
(She’s already staring at him like she’s watching a Netflix show.)
“I always wanted to visit NTPC — you know, the power plant. I don’t know why, it just fascinated me. So I bought a ticket, got on the train, and changed into a different outfit I’d packed. I planned the whole thing — the train ride was two hours, and I had around seven hours before school ended. It felt perfect.”

She (blinking in disbelief):
“So you… bunked school… packed clothes… and went on a solo train adventure to see how electricity is made?”
(Beat)
“That’s insane. And you were what — 14? 15? What if someone had kidnapped you?!”

He (grinning faintly):
“Well, I didn’t. So let me continue.”

(She’s visibly worried now, but trying to hide it. He notices but keeps talking.)

He:
“Everything was fine. Until I reached my destination. Or rather — I should’ve reached my destination… but I didn’t realize it had arrived. So I just sat there like an idiot. And the train — being an express — didn’t stop again for a long while. By the time I realized I’d missed my stop… I went completely blank.
People were asking me questions, and I just sat there like: ‘Sir, my top floor is under maintenance, please hold.’”
(He smirks)
“I was trying to process the disaster I just created — and it was already time for school to be over.”

She (emotions hitting her all at once):
“Oh my god. That’s— that’s kinda hilarious but terrifying. How the hell could you mess up like that? You’re the most calculated person I’ve ever met.”

He:
“Well… that’s where I learned one of the biggest lessons of my life.
Never make the same mistake twice.
And always — always — think twice, act once.”

She (softly):
“Yeah… that’s one of the things I love about you. That confidence you carry, like you’ve lived a thousand lives already.”
(She pauses, eyes wide)
“Wait— wait. So what happened next?! Did someone… kidnap you?”

(He looks at her like “what the hell,” while she starts to giggle nervously.)

She:
“Okay, okay, sorry! I watch way too many crime shows. They always have endings like:
‘Based on real events.’
So I thought maybe… you got sold to the power plant or something.”

(They both break into laughter, tension diffused.)

He continued:
“There were so many people around me, all asking questions—‘Where are you from, kid?’, ‘Which station are you headed to?’, and the worst one—‘Oh no, that station already passed. The train won’t stop again until the final destination.’ And in that moment, I just... sank. I was like, ‘What the hell have I done?’ Total panic mode.

Then, this elderly man sitting nearby noticed me freaking out. He was the calm one among the chaos, asked about my family, and oddly enough—he actually knew my father when I mentioned his name. He told me to call home, so I did.

Now here’s the weird part—my dad was calm. Like monk-level calm. Nirvana achieved. He just went, ‘Hmm, I see... well, you reap what you sow. Okay, here, talk to your mother.’”

She:
“Wait—what? How could your dad be so chill at a time like that?”

He:
“Right? Total contrast. My mom, on the other hand—emotional rollercoaster. She cried, she yelled. I told her I just wanted to see NTPC, and now somehow I’m headed to West Bengal. I even joked that this might be our last call, so she should record it in case she ever missed me.

She had me on speaker, and my dad—still zen mode—just said, ‘Don’t worry. When you reach the final station, find a TT or the police and explain. Or call me, and I’ll handle it. I’m boarding the next train to come get you.’”

She (wide-eyed):
“Damn... your dad really is something. And honestly, I can see so much of him in you.”

He (smirking):
“Yeah, a lot of people say that. The resemblance, the calmness... runs in the blood, I guess.”

She:
“But why didn’t you ever tell me this legendary story before? If I knew, I’d have made you spill the beans ages ago—maybe even beaten it out of you.”

He:
“Exactly why I didn’t tell you. I know how you'd react.”

He (continuing):
“Anyway, that old man took the phone, spoke to my dad for a bit, and then gave it back. A while later, my dad called and told me to go with the old man. Apparently, he worked at the NTPC and knew someone in charge there. My dad had already spoken with them, and said the man would take me in for the night and bring me back the next day. I just had to call every hour to check in.

And just like that, I reached West Bengal with this complete stranger—who turned out to be a genuinely good person. He took me to his home, made sure I was okay, and brought me back safely the next day.”

She (leaning in, smirking):
“Well, that was quite the adventure. But... where’s the romance you promised? You teased me with it.”

He:
“Well… the romance part happened at the old man's house. He had a granddaughter visiting at the time. At first, she kept her distance, probably trying to figure out who this random boy was that her grandfather brought home. But slowly, she started opening up.

She showed me around the place, took me to some local spots, and we ended up talking for hours. That night, we even shared the same bed. She was just a year older than me.

The next day, the three of us—me, her, and the old man—boarded a train. She was returning to her home too; her stop came before ours, and someone from her family was going to pick her up at the station.

We sat together on the train, laughed a lot, and just... enjoyed the ride back. When her station came, her father was waiting. She smiled, waved, and left. I continued with the old man, and by evening, we reached my hometown. My dad was there waiting for me.”

She:
“Aww, that’s so sweet. So, did you guys stay in touch?”

He:
“Yeah. She used to call me from her mom’s phone. And after a few days, she actually proposed to me. That was the start of our long-distance thing.

I was in 10th grade at the time, and she’d just finished her boards. She scored pretty well. Life was moving ahead, but we were still glued to the phone every night, talking for hours. Our love just kept growing.”

She (starting to feel uneasy):
“Okay... so what’s the tragedy here? Don’t tell me—she dumped you?”

He (quietly):
“Yeah… slowly, the calls started reducing. From everyday to once in a while. And then, around November–December, they stopped altogether.

I kept calling, but she wouldn’t talk much—always said she was busy and hung up. I had no idea what was going on. My board exams were right around the corner.

Then, just a few days before my math paper, she called. I thought maybe everything was fine. But instead… she told me we couldn’t talk anymore. She asked me not to call her again.

I asked why—and she said she was getting married.”

She (stunned):
“What the hell…?”

He:
“That hit me like a train. I didn’t know how to respond. I was just... blank. But I still gave my exams. Scored well too.

But at what cost?”

She (softly):
“Damn…”

---

she stays quiet for a beat, her fingers absentmindedly twirling a loose strand of hair. Then she glances up at him, eyes softer now.
she: So... she just left like that? No fight, no warning?

he lets out a dry chuckle, but there’s no humor in it. He leans back against the wall, tilts his head to look at the sky.
he: Yeah. Just one call and boom. Gone.
A pause. He exhales, slowly.
he: I mean... I get it. Maybe she had her reasons. Pressure, family, whatever. Still felt like shit though.

she nods slowly, her gaze dropping to her lap.
she: Must’ve been... hard.
Then, with a slight smirk tugging at the edge of her lips—
she: And here I thought I was the queen of teenage heartbreak. Guess you snatched the crown.

she shifts closer, her tone softening.
she: Tell me more. About your past. I want to know the person I love.

He stiffens just a little at her words—didn't see that one coming. For a moment, his eyes search hers, like he’s trying to figure out if she meant it.
he: What’s the point? We’ll both go our own ways eventually... or are you planning to gather ammo to blackmail me later?

she: Who knows? But one thing’s for sure—I'm not going anywhere. We’ll walk the same path.

He looks at her for a long moment, something unspoken flickering behind his eyes. Then he picks up his cigarette pack, taps one out with practiced fingers, lights it. The first drag hangs in the air between them.

he (half-smiling): Let’s see how long you hold onto that.

And with that, he pushes himself up and walks toward the balcony, smoke trailing behind.

she watches him go, then scoffs under her breath.
she: Where the hell are you going now, Shakespeare?

he (without turning): Thought it’d look cool if I ended the line and walked away dramatically.

she: Cool my ass! She gets up and follows him, poking his side with two fingers. Sit down and explain what that cryptic crap meant. And don’t try me, or I’ll beat you so bad you’ll cry in Morse code.

he turns to look at her, caught between amusement and disbelief, lips curling into a crooked grin.
he: You’re insane.

she: You’re welcome.

She:
“So tell me… do you still miss her? Or is it just… some leftover feeling messing with your head?”

He lets out a soft breath, not quite a sigh, just enough to fog up the silence. He leans forward, elbows on knees, staring down at his fingers like they might spell the answer out for him.

He:
“No. It’s not that. I don’t feel anything for her anymore. Or the school crush either. That chapter’s done.”
He pauses, picking at the edge of his thumbnail, then glances up at her.
“The part that messes with me… is how easily I forgot them. Like they were just… placeholders in time. Blips. Nothing.”

She studies him quietly, the way his shoulders slope just slightly when he says that. It clicks for her—what he’s really saying. That it’s not about them at all. It’s about him. The way he detaches. The way things slip through his hands and leave barely a mark.

She:
“Do you regret that?”

He leans back, arms spread across the back of the couch, eyes drifting up to the ceiling like the answers might be carved there.

He:
“I don’t know. I mean… I’m genuinely happy for them. I hope they’re doing well, living good lives. But the weird part? I can’t even remember their faces. Or their voices. It’s like… they were dreams I forgot right after waking up.”

She doesn’t speak right away. She sits beside him, tracing the lines on her palm, like looking for something there too. Then:

She (softly):
“Maybe that’s your way of surviving. Like your mind files things away when they stop mattering. Even if your heart doesn’t agree.”

He doesn’t reply, just nods a little, eyes still far off. She reaches out and gently tugs on his sleeve.

She:
“But I hope… I’m not that easy to forget.”

That brings his eyes back to her. Slowly. Like he’s coming out of a tunnel.

He:
“You won’t be. Even if I wanted to. You’re the part that doesn’t feel like a dream.”

She breaks eye contact, biting back a smile that almost slips through.

She:
“Good. 'Cause if you ever forget me, I’ll haunt you like a ghost.”

He chuckles under his breath.

He:
“That sounds about right.”

---


She:
“So tell me about the second one. Or just… tell me more about your past. I want to understand what made you think the way you do now.”

He leans back a little, smirking.
He:
“Well then, time for a flashback...”
He raises an imaginary curtain with his hands.
“So, this was around 12th grade. There was this girl in my college. Lively, charming—”

She cuts in immediately, raising an eyebrow.
She:
“Why do you always start like that? ‘Charming,’ really? You never call me charming. I get none of this praise.”

He grins, putting a hand to his chest mockingly.
He:
“Ah, forgive me, mylady. I shall rephrase for your royal standards.”

She leans back, arms crossed but amused.
She:
“Hmm. I hope so.”

He:
“So, during college, there was this girl. Not charming, not lively—just… existing. But somehow, she caught my attention. Even then, I kept my distance.”
He glances over at her for effect.
“She was friends with this other girl—technically my cousin, but the connection was buried somewhere in the ancient family tree. We all lived in the same neighborhood. So, this ‘not-so-charming’ girl used to visit often.”

She smirks, shaking her head.
She:
“Girls just keep falling into your lap, huh?”

He shrugs, chuckling.
He:
“Beats me. Honestly, I still don’t get how I pulled you. I mean, you’re a straight 10/10 baddie, and yet… here we are.”

She acts like she’s flipping her hair.
She:
“Damn right. Now keep going, I want to hear where this one crashes.”

He:
“Alright, so one day, my cousin’s mom called me over. I thought it was just some errand, but nope—both girls were sitting there, getting a lecture from aunty.”
He smiles a little at the memory.
“Apparently, since I was the ‘studious one’ with good grades, aunty thought I’d be a great tutor for both of them—Maths, Physics, Chem. And so began the evening tuition sessions at their place.”

She:
“Let me guess—fate played its role?”

He:
“Exactly. I didn’t try to mix with them, but fate clearly didn’t care. A few months in, she started getting bolder. Closer. I noticed it… but said nothing. I wanted to see how far she’d go.”

He takes a second here, remembering.

He:
“And yeah, she went far. After four-five months of tutoring and chatting more during college hours, she somehow got my number from my cousin. Started with study doubts… then flirting.”
He makes a small ‘tsk’ noise.
“And one day, she proposed. And me being the ‘go with the flow’ kind of guy… well, I got another girlfriend.”

She mock gasps.
She:
“You really are a playboy, huh?”

He:
“I’m not!”

She raises a brow, leaning toward him slightly.
She:
“Oh, but you’re walking the path. You’ve got the potential. And tell me—why is it always the girl who confesses? Even I had to confess first, if I remember correctly.”

He, grinning like a fool now:
“That’s just… the effect of my charm.”

She, narrowing her eyes:
“Cheeky little shit. Do you want me to start feeding you porridge from now on?”

He, confused:
“Wait, why?”

She:
“Because you won’t have teeth left to chew with if you keep this up.”

He bursts out laughing, trying to cover his mouth as if it would save him.


She: So what happened next? How far did you even go with her?

He: Nowhere, really. I never tend to get intimate with anyone.

She leans back, raising a brow.

She: So… she’s just like me. Just existing there.

He: Damn, that kinda stings when you put it like that.

She: Well, it’s true. You never did anything with any of them. The childhood one ghosted you. The second was long distance—so, hands-off. And this one? You’re saying you didn’t even kiss?

He: Nope.

She (mock gasps): What a waste. And here I thought you could become a legendary playboy, charming girls into bed with just a smile. But no—turns out, you haven’t even kissed anyone. Are you sure you’re not… I dunno, impotent? Or maybe gay?

He (deadpan): Okay, now you’re just being dramatic. I’m not gay. I… verified.

She (leans forward, curious): Verified? How?!

He: It's not what you're imagining. I just… wondered why I wasn’t feeling “that way” towards anyone. So one day, I watched some gay porn. Just to test. Turns out, nope—didn't like it. Actually messed me up for a few days. I couldn’t even watch regular stuff after that.

She: Hmm… interesting. Still, I think I need to verify this personally. I mean, imagine—we get married and find out you’re broken. No kids. Our families looking at us like we’re cursed.

He (half-laughing): You might have a point. Maybe we should verify.

She smirks—he’s fallen into her trap.

She: Great. Strip.

He (blinks): What?

She (unfazed): Let’s get this over with. Gotta check if the machinery’s functional.

He: Alright—wait, hold on. What the hell are you trying to do?

She: Quality inspection. Standard procedure.

He: It works, okay? I checked it last night. Fully operational.

She curses under her breath, her plan slipping.

She: Yeah, but I haven’t verified it.

He: Why do you need to verify it?

She: Because I’m your girlfriend. I have the right to know everything about you.

He: You won’t be my girlfriend for long. We’re literally talking about breaking up.

She: Yet. We're talking. Until then, I still have girlfriend privileges.

While she’s talking, she sneakily reaches for his belt. His eyes go wide.

He (startled): Hey! No! I’m not mentally prepared for this!

He scrambles away, fumbling backwards toward the door.

She: You’re acting like a maiden right now.

He: And you’re acting like a pervert out for my body!

She (grinning): Hmmm, yeah. Hahahaha!

He (half out the door, mock yelling): Someone save me from this predator!

---

She stepped forward, a glint in her eyes, and before he could react, she gently nudged him backward and shut the balcony door behind him. The click of the latch echoed louder than expected in the stillness.

He looked around—the narrow balcony, the quiet street below, the fading sky. He sighed.
No escape. No backup plan. Just her, inside, with that mischievous look in her eyes.

He muttered under his breath, “She wouldn’t actually try undressing me out here… would she?”
Then a second thought hit.
“…Wait. She might.”

He: “What do you want?”

She leaned against the glass, voice low now, not teasing but calm—intentional.
She: “I want you.”

His eyes narrowed.
He: “Yeah… that’s not something I can give. Pick something else.”

She didn’t miss a beat, pointing toward the lower half of his body with mock seriousness.
She: “Then I want that.”

He: “That’s off-limits.”

She: “Then I’ll take it by force.”

Cornered, he exhaled and dropped the facade. No more dodging, no more snark.
He straightened, stepped forward slowly.

She: (raising a brow) “So… you’ve surrendered?”

But he said nothing—just kept walking toward her. Not aggressive, not tense—just… quiet.

Something in his expression made her pulse still. The fire behind her teasing dimmed into confusion, then softened into something else. She instinctively backed up, unlocking the door and stepping aside.

And that’s when he pulled her into a hug—firm, steady, unexpected.

She froze for half a second, not understanding… then melted into it without asking questions. She rested her chin near his shoulder, arms sliding around him gently.

She: “Don’t worry. Nothing’s gonna happen. And even if it does, we’ll face it together. I’m not letting go.”

He pulled her just a little closer, his voice barely above a whisper.

He: “I believe you. Just… don’t leave me like the others.”

She smiled softly against his neck.

She: “That’s not happening. You’re stuck with me now. Like a leech.”

He chuckled through his nose, a breath of warmth in her hair.

Later, they returned to the room, the night quieter now—like even time had slowed down to watch them. She sat over him, sideways on the chair, legs curled gently as he pulled her in close, arms around her like instinct. It was their first time being this physically close, skin brushing, breaths syncing, her hair occasionally tickling his face in the breeze from the open window.

Her perfume—soft and floral—mixed with something uniquely her. It grounded him and sent his thoughts into a haze he didn’t fully understand yet.

She smiled faintly, watching him absentmindedly play with the strands of her hair as he spoke. That smile... it sent a flutter through him.

He (softly): “So yeah, just like that… we began dating. She proposed, we met often at college, nothing felt drastically different for me, but for her… everything shifted. She looked at me more often, smiled more. We started sharing lunch under a tree—simple meals, split in halves. My sister would show up sometimes, and we’d act like nothing was going on. But I think she had a hunch. She knew her friend was acting different.”

She nodded, listening, arms draped lazily over his shoulders.

He (continuing): “After class, we’d go to the park nearby—me, her, and my sister. It became our routine. Everything was just… calm. Sometimes, we’d see couples kissing—playing with their mouths.”

She (grinning): “Wait. Playing with mouths? What even is that?”

He (mock shocked): “You’re surprisingly innocent, especially after what you tried earlier.”

She turned to look at him, confused. Their faces were inches apart.

He gently touched her lips, a light press of his fingers.

He: “It’s a French kiss. No hands involved. Just two people digging for treasure in each other’s mouths.”

She (gagging playfully): “Yuck! What the hell is that description? I feel like throwing up now.”

He (nodding): “Exactly the feeling I get when people talk about kissing.”

She: “You make it sound like a health hazard.”

He (grinning like a mad scientist): “It is! A germ-sharing ritual. Viruses, bacteria, exchange of salivas. Disgusting.”

She smirked. A dangerous one.

He noticed—too late.

Before he could piece it together, she was already in motion, facing him fully in his lap. One hand on his cheek, the other slipping into his hair. And then—she kissed him.

He froze.

Tried to resist, to say something clever—but his brain short-circuited. And just like that, all defenses were gone. He surrendered.

They kissed.

Slowly at first, then deeper—tongues colliding, not in battle, but in exploration. For the first time, he let instinct take over, and she met it halfway. Warm. Hungry. Gentle. Wild.

When they finally parted, she was grinning.

She: “Hmm… I can now confirm, your machine isn’t faulty.”

He blinked, still dazed.

She (with a wicked smile): “I also feel something rising… and it’s definitely not the Shield Hero.”

He groaned, throwing his head back.
He: “Another soldier lost… without even drawing a sword.”

She leaned forward, resting her forehead against his.
She (softly): “Don’t worry. I’ll heal you after battle.”

She:
"So… how was it? Your first kiss?"

He:
"I don't even have the words. But I will say this—fuck those scientists and doctors who said kissing is unhygienic and unhealthy. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever felt. Honestly, I think they just never got to experience it themselves, so they decided to slander it. And like an idiot, I believed them."

She (laughs):
"You really let it all out, huh? Well then, from now on, kiss me more often. I'm not taking the lead every single time."

He (a bit shy):
"Yes, my lady… as you wish."

She (smiling warmly):
"I'm glad you never gave it to anyone else. Thank them, actually, for not stealing it from me. I’m the one who got to have your first time… that’s something special."

(She leans in a little closer, but her smile fades slightly as she asks the next question.)

She:
"So… what happened? Why did you two break up?"

He:
"It was because of her. I kept telling her to focus on her studies, to not lose sight of what matters… but after she proposed, it was like nothing else existed for her anymore. She stopped paying attention in class, kept daydreaming, glancing at me instead of at the board, always planning our next park visit or movie night instead of prepping for exams.

Then board exams hit. I passed with good grades… she failed. I tried to push her, to motivate her, helped her prepare for the compartment exam—but she failed again. Eventually… her father had enough. He got her married off."

(He looks down for a second, then forces a bitter smile.)

He:
"I think I’m cursed. Everyone who falls in love with me ends up married… just not to me."

(She stays quiet for a moment, then looks at him with a teasing but sad smile.)

She:
"Let’s see… your school crush ghosted you. The long-distance one got married. Now your college sweetheart too… Maybe it's my turn now?"

He:
"And that’s exactly why I told you we should break up. I don’t want to watch it happen again. I can't go through that again."


She (leans back slightly on his lap, playing with his fingers):
"You know… sometimes I wonder if people like us are meant to last. Not because there’s something wrong between us… but because the world just doesn’t seem to allow it."

He (quietly, eyes on the floor):
"Yeah. It’s like… every time I feel something real, it slips through my fingers. I hold on tight, but the world just finds a way to take it away."

She:
"And still, you keep trying. Even when you told me to break up, I knew you didn’t want that… not really."

He:
"It’s not about wanting. It’s about preparing. If history repeats, then what’s the point of getting attached to something I might lose again?"

She (softly):
"But what if this time, history needs rewriting?"

He (sighs):
"That’s easy to say now. But time… time wears everything down. One day it’s distance. The next, it's circumstances. Family. Careers. Expectations. You never know what hits you next."

She:
"And what if we get hit… and we don’t break?"

(He looks at her, surprised by her words. She’s not smiling now. She's serious. Grounded. Certain.)

He:
"You really believe that?"

She:
"I don’t believe it. I choose it. There’s a difference."

(A pause. The breeze hits them again, brushing her hair over his face. He closes his eyes. She gently brushes the strands away.)

She (with a small laugh):
"You think I’m scared of a little bad luck? C’mon… I’ve already kissed you. That’s like signing a contract with fate."

He (half-smiling):
"Then we’re both doomed."

She (grinning):
"Then we’ll be doomed together."

(The silence between them grows tender. The heaviness of the conversation lingers, but it no longer feels like a burden — more like something shared, something lighter now that it’s out in the open.)

He (softly):
"You really mean it, don’t you?"

She (nods, gently resting her forehead against his):
"Every word. I’m not running. Not now. Not ever."

(He lifts his hand, brushing her cheek, his thumb tracing the edge of her lips.)

He (barely audible):
"I never thought someone would stay."

She (smiling):
"Then I’ll just have to keep proving you wrong."

(She leans in slowly, and this time the kiss is different. Not hurried, not impulsive — it’s slower, deeper, filled with a silent promise. His hands hold her like she’s something fragile yet fierce. Her fingers tangle in his hair, pulling him closer for a moment longer.)

(When they part, their breaths are still tangled, and she lingers for just a heartbeat more before slowly rising from his lap.)

She:
"I should go. My roommate's already suspicious… and if she finds out I’m not in the dorm, she’ll think I’m out committing war crimes."

He (half-laughing, still catching his breath):
"Tell her you were. Emotionally."

She (grinning as she fixes her hair):
"Only on you."

(She walks to the door, then pauses and looks back, eyes softer than ever.)

She:
"Don’t overthink tonight, okay? Just… hold onto how it felt."

He:
"I will. Promise."

She (with a wink):
"And maybe next time, you take the lead."

(And with that, she slips out of the room quietly, leaving behind the scent of her perfume and a thousand thoughts buzzing in his mind. He watches the door for a moment longer before leaning back in his chair, eyes closed — heart full, mind racing.)

He sat in the quiet, her perfume lingering like a question he couldn’t answer, then reached for his phone.

He calls his friend.

dk: Hello?

He: Where are you?

dk: Near the shopping complex. Do i Need to grab something for you.

He: Hmm. I wanna get drunk tonight.

dk: What? Why?

He: Just… I don’t know. I need something hard.

dk: I’m with her right now, can’t leave immediately. But I’ll call vir and ask him to bring you something.

He: Alright. Just make sure it hits hard.

dk: Something happened?

He: …Hmm.

dk: Wait, I’m coming right now.

He: It’s not urgent. Are you staying at her place tonight?

dk: No, I’ll drop her off and come to you.

dk's girlfriend: What’s going on? Are you going somewhere?

dk: Yeah, I won’t be staying tonight.

He: You don’t have to come. Just ask someone to get me a bottle.

dk: Bro, you can’t even tolerate water with spice. I’m not letting you drink alone.

He: You act like my mom sometimes.

dk: Well, she did tell me to look after you.

He: …Alright. I’ll wait.


The night air was cool against her skin as she walked back, the memory of his lips still burning, her steps heavier than they should’ve been.
On her way back, she gets a call from her roommate.

naina: Where are you? You’re not back yet?

She: I’m on my way. By the way Do we have any liquor in the room?

naina: Yeah, I brought a bottle today. We were about to start.

She: Don’t start without me. I need it more than all of you combined.

naina: Damn. What happened? Don’t tell me he dumped you.

She: No… but he was going to.

naina: Ugh, I told you. All guys are the same. They just want the body.

She: It’s not like that. Just… leave it. I’ll explain later. I’ll be there in five mins.

naina: Alright, we’re waiting.



\[INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT\]

The room looked like a battlefield of broken cravings—empty pizza boxes stacked like crooked monuments to laziness, a flickering bulb swinging gently, casting warped shadows across the peeling walls. A musty haze of alcohol, sweat, and the kind of silence that follows emotional storms clung to the air like humidity.

He was sprawled on the old couch like a body dumped there by fate, a half-finished bottle of whiskey cradled in one hand, his glass dangling between two fingers like a dying cigarette.

dk sat cross-legged on the dusty floor, a bottle of beer resting on his knee, head tilted like he was trying to solve a riddle. vir, already a few shots deep, was lounging on a high stool near the broken window, grinning like a fox who’d found the henhouse.

dk: (watching him down another swig)
“So you’re already halfway through that bottle, and still haven’t said a word. Spill it.”

vir: (snorts)
“He got dumped. Look at him—he’s got that dead-fish-on-a-frying-pan energy.”

dk: (choking on laughter)
“Stop it! Don’t kill me while I’m drinking!”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he turned his face toward the window, staring at the moon as if it might blink back at him. A faint, helpless smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

vir: (nudging dk)
“Look at that. He’s smiling like an idiot. Nah, they didn’t break up.”

dk: (squinting)
“Yeah… you're right. That’s not heartbreak. That’s the look of someone who just floated out of a dream.”

He: (still looking out the window, voice quiet)
“Don’t bother me for a bit. Just... let me feel this for a while.”

vir: (grinning)
“Oh ho ho! I think I know exactly what's happening here.”

dk: “Oh, please, enlighten us, O great love guru.”

vir: (bowing like a sage)
“Yes, my child. After deep meditation and two tequila shots, I have seen the truth, this man has achieved Nirvana.”

dk: (eyes wide, playing along)
“Oooh, sensei! What is Nirvana?”

vir: (sipping solemnly)
“Nirvana, my child, is the sacred state achieved when two souls unite in physical cardio under the divine protection of a blanket.”

dk: “Wait... isn’t that just sex?”

vir: (slamming his hand down dramatically)
“Blasphemy! How dare you reduce the sacred art of Nirvana to such crude words! You have insulted the temple!”

dk: (panicking, laughing)
“I’m sorry, guruji! Forgive this foolish disciple!”

He: (finally turning, a tired smile on his lips)
“Can you both shut up for a second? And no, we didn’t do that.”

vir: (smirking)
“Of course you didn’t. No sane girl would let you do that.”

dk: (losing it, bursting into laughter)
“He got you there, man.”

He: (smiling faintly, but there's a shadow under it)
“You know what’s wild? I finally found someone who makes me feel… calm. Not excited. Not scared. Just… still.”

dk: (more sober now)
“And that scared you?”

He: (nods slowly)
“Yeah. Because every time I’ve felt like this before... it ended badly. My school crush ghosted me, the long-distance one got married off, and now this one’s ready to fight fate just to stay with me. I’m scared I’ll ruin her too.”

vir: (softening)
“Maybe this time, don’t pull away. Maybe it’s not about avoiding the fall... maybe it’s about learning to land.”

dk: (lifting his beer)
“To learning how to land.”

He: (clinking glasses)
“To not being a curse anymore.”

vir: (grinning)
“To Nirvana... someday.”



She reached her dorm, knocked once.

The door creaked open and Naina stood there, leaning slightly on the frame, hair tied in a loose bun, expression unreadable.

Naina:
“You’re late.”

fl walked in without answering, eyes drifting to the table — bottles already out, packet of chips torn open, glasses half-prepped. They’d been waiting.

The room is dim, one lamp switched on with a soft yellow glow. There’s an open window letting in a little breeze, a bottle of vodka on the floor with a few packets of chips scattered around.

fl: (tiredly)
“Yeah. Today was... hectic.”

She toed off her shoes slowly, each movement dragging. Pulled off her top and tossed it toward her chair before slipping into her old hoodie, the one that always hung off one shoulder.

Simran, who was sitting cross-legged on the bed, shifted a little.

Simran:
“Where were you though? You never stay out this long.”

fl: (pulling her hair up in a bun, not looking at them)
“To the usual place.”

Simran: (teasing)
“Oooh, did he not let you leave, or was it you who didn’t want to come back, hmm?”

fl: (reaches for the bottle, expression flat)
“It’s not like that. I’m just tired, Simran. Don’t poke me. Let me drink in peace for a while.”

Naina watched her quietly as she poured herself a shot — not bothering to mix, not bothering to sit down either.

Naina:
“Okay, drink all you want. Sleep like a log after. But first... spill what happened.”

Simran sat up straighter like a child being told a bedtime story was about to begin. That familiar mischievous glint in her eyes.

fl: (pours, chugs without a blink)
“Not in the mood.”

Simran: (blinks)
“Wait, that was a straight shot? No mix? Whoa.”

fl: (wiping her mouth with the back of her sleeve)
“I said don’t poke me.”

She finally sat on the floor, back resting against her bed, legs outstretched. The bottle sat beside her now like some old friend she didn’t really trust.

Naina raised her eyebrows.

Naina:
“What’s with you acting like a drunk uncle at a wedding?”

fl: (quietly, like to herself)
“That’s the shit.”

Simran took a tiny sip from her own glass, frowned.

Simran:
“This one burns. What brand is this? You changed it?”

Naina: (munching a chip)
“She said she wanted something hard. So not the usual. It’s heavier.”

Simran:
“Damn. What kinda emotional earthquake needs this level of alcohol?”

She turned to Naina with exaggerated suspicion.

Simran:
“She told you something, right? Don’t lie. What happened? Why is she drinking like her soul left her body?”

Naina: (nonchalant)
“Something like... she got dumped?”

Simran: (eyes widening)
“Ohhh. That explains everything.”

fl: (not even turning)
“I’m not dumped. You’re dumped.”

Simran: (grinning)
“Sure, baby. Keep telling yourself that. He used you and ghosted you. Classic move.”

fl: (sharp now)
“Simran. Shut up.”

A brief silence. Simran looked toward Naina and grinned under her breath.

Naina: (whispers)
“Wait for it. Give her one more drink. She’s already wobbling.”

Simran: (murmuring)
“She’s gonna drop a truth bomb soon. I can feel it.”

Naina took another sip, watching fl carefully like a cat waiting for a mouse to twitch.

Naina:
“You should eat something too. You’re drinking too fast.”

Simran:
“I agree. This one’s not juice. You’ll pass out before we get any gossip.”

fl reached for another shot, poured it with shaky hands. She didn’t speak. Just stared at the liquid like it might say something back.

Naina leaned in slightly.

Naina:
“You sure you don’t wanna mix something in? Or are you aiming to forget your own name tonight?”

fl looked up, eyes red-rimmed — not from crying, just tired.

fl:
“I don’t need anything. Just leave me alone for a bit.”


Simran kept fiddling with the edge of her glass, side-eyeing fl like she was trying to decode a foreign script.

Simran:
“You’re too quiet. It’s weird. You usually get chatty after the second shot.”

fl didn’t respond. She was still staring at the floor, back against the bed, shoulders slumped. Not sad exactly — just heavy.

Naina:
“She’s not gonna talk like this. She needs a trigger.”

Simran: (grinning)
“You want me to slap her?”

fl: (dry)
“I’ll throw you off the balcony.”

Simran: (mock offended)
“Wow. So violent. And here I was about to offer emotional support.”

Naina: (sipping slowly)
“Maybe emotional support is the problem.”

fl: (exhales)
“Guys, I said drop it—”

Simran:
“We will. We totally will. After you answer at least one question.”

fl: (leans her head back, eyes closed)
“You both are like mosquitoes. Buzzing till you get slapped.”

Naina: (calmly)
“Then slap us. But spill something first.”

Simran: (leans forward, hands clasped)
“Fine. Let’s start easy. Did you two fight?”

fl: (quietly)
“No.”

Naina:
“Then what? Did he say something weird? flirt with someone else? Did you flirt with someone else?”

Simran:
“Oooh. Did you try to make him jealous? Like old-school tactics?”

fl: (opens one eye)
“God, no. That’s so... eighth grade.”

Simran:
“Then what?”

fl: (shrugs)
“He said... something odd. That’s all.”

Naina:
“Odd like how?”

fl: (hesitating)
“Just... stuff about his past. His life.”

Simran: (already invested)
“Ah-ha. Family drama?”

fl: (nope)
“No.”

Naina: (thoughtful)
“Ex-girlfriends?”

fl: (pauses)
“...Yeah. That.”

Simran:
“Ohhhh. How many are we talking here? Two? Three? A football team?”

fl: (rubbing her temple)
“Three.”

Simran: (clapping her hands)
“Bingo! I knew it. I smelled history.”

Naina:
“Three is not insane. Could be worse.”

Simran: (to Naina)
“Yeah but he’s got that mysterious vibe, you know? The kind of guy who says ‘I’ve loved and lost’ and then stares at the rain dramatically.”

fl: (half-laughs)
“He doesn’t stare at rain. He just... goes quiet.”

Naina:
“So what? Did one of them cheat on him?”

fl: (murmuring)
“One ghosted him. Second ran away. Third failed and got married off.”

Simran: (sits up, wide-eyed)
“Wait wait wait. Ran away from him or with someone?”

fl:
“From home.”

Simran:
“Holy shit. What is he? A Bollywood test?”

Naina: (frowning)
“So all of them left? And now he thinks you’ll leave too?”

fl nods.

Simran: (mock gasp)
“He thinks you are going to get married?”

fl:
“Not exactly. He just... thinks everyone who loves him ends up leaving. Or being taken.”

Naina:
“Dude. That's not a curse. That’s depression.”

Simran:
“Okay but like... he seriously thought of breaking up just to avoid watching you leave later?”

fl: (nods again, slower this time)
“Yeah. He thought... maybe it’s better to push me away now.”

Simran: (picks up a chip, stares at it)
“That’s so messed up. Romantic, but messed up.”

Naina: (quietly)
“So what did you say?”

fl: (sips again, then smirks)
“I kissed him.”

Simran: (spits out her drink)
“WHAT—”

fl:
“Twice.”

Naina: (finally smiling)
“And then?”

fl: (leans her head back)
“He shut up.”

Simran: (laughing)
“You shut him up with lips. Powerful move.”

Naina: (pointing a chip at her)
“You sure you’re not the one who cursed him now?”

Simran:
“Or maybe you're his final boss. After three failed relationships, the game throws you in.”

fl: (quietly, still smiling)
“Maybe.”

Simran: (suddenly serious)
“Wait. You didn’t sleep with him, right?”

fl: (opens one eye)
“No.”

Simran:
“Good. Don’t do it when he’s in this weird state. Boys say all kinds of stuff post-tragedy.”

Naina: (sipping, thoughtfully)
“I don’t think he’s being manipulative. Just scared.”

fl: (nodding)
“He’s not a bad guy. Just tired.”

Simran: (laying back on the floor)
“We all are, babe.”
