<!-- ### Chapter 1 — Cigarettes and Shells   -->
**[INT. HIS ROOM — DAY]**

The room was dim, a lazy mess of half-finished thoughts and things left undone. Light filtered in through old curtains, dust catching in the sunbeams like static. Somewhere between boredom and habit, his phone began to ring.

He answered with a thumb swipe, already leaning back in his chair.

**He** (picking up): Hello?

**She** (direct, playful): Where are you?

**He**: Same old cave — the usual.

**She**: Try crawling out of that turtle shell you call a room, will you?

He let out a dry chuckle, rubbing a hand over his face.

**He**: You do realize a turtle can’t come out of its shell, right?

**She**: Idiot. Anyway, I’m coming over.

**He**: Why?

**She**: I just… wanted to see you.

**He**: And why would you want to do that?

**She**: I don’t know. Just felt like it.

There was a brief pause. He shifted in his chair, glanced toward the window, then back at the ceiling.

**He**: Huh. Where are you right now?

**She**: Near the convenience store.

**He**: Great. Grab me a pack of smokes.

**She**: Mhm. Anything else, your highness?

He glanced at the lighter on his desk, flicked it. No spark.

**He**: Yeah, my lighter’s dead. Get one of those too.

**She**: Noted.

**He**: And get something for yourself while you’re at it. My treat.

A beat.

**She** (mock-surprised): Oh wow, someone’s feeling generous today. What’s the occasion?

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he stared at the dust dancing in the light. His voice dropped, softer now.

**He**: You’ll know in a while.


**[INT. HIS ROOM — LATER]**

She opens the door.

He’s seated on a chair, a book in hand, glasses slipping slightly down his nose. Behind him, a cluttered desk — half chaos, half sanctuary — books stacked like a scholar’s wall, a laptop glowing quietly. A single chair faces him. Beyond it, a large window opens to the mountains. A bird's nest sways gently in the tree just outside. Peace lives here.

She walks in without knocking — like always — and tosses the cigarette pack and lighter onto the desk. It skitters slightly across the wood.

She settles into the chair across from him, her eyes briefly scanning the room like she’s checking for changes. None. She leans back, legs crossed.

Without a word, he gets up and walks into the kitchen, the soft creak of the floorboard following him.

**She** (calling out, half-curious, half-teasing): So… what’s the occasion?

**He** (from the kitchen, voice steady): Thinking of breaking up.

The air pauses.

She blinks, just once. The crease between her brows tightens, but only for a second.

**She** (casually): And… what brought that brilliant idea?

**He** (stirring coffee, metal spoon tapping the side of the cup): A cocktail of thoughts. But for simplicity’s sake… we just don’t work.

**She** (quietly): So you’re saying I’m not good for you?

He exhales, slow and shallow, leaning on the counter.

**He**: No, my lady. It’s the opposite. You’re the noble princess in a crystal tower, and I’m the guy milking sheep in the valley. Society wouldn’t root for this genre of love story.

She lets out a faint exhale through her nose. A smile ghosts across her lips but doesn’t stay.

**She**: I don’t care about society.

**He**: Well, I do. Society gives us jobs, money, overpriced WiFi, and bread. Unless, of course, you’re up for farming? I could teach you how to dig potatoes.

She rolls her eyes — a slow, tired motion.

**She**: Stop dodging and talk. What actually happened? Did someone say something?

**He** (still facing the counter): Someone did say something. *(pauses)* By the way — how much sugar? Still on that anti-sweetness diet?

**She**: No sugar. You’ve already made the day bitter enough.

His jaw twitches, but he nods and pours the coffee anyway.

**She**: So? What did this mysterious *someone* say?

**He**: They told me to look in the mirror.

**She**: And?

**He**: They said, *“She looks like milk and moonlight, like an angel on vacation from heaven. You, my friend, look like charcoal that lost the will to burn.”*

She bursts into laughter, hands pressed lightly to her mouth, eyes squinting shut.

**She**: That’s what made you spiral? Seriously?

He walks over and hands her the coffee. Their fingers don’t touch, but the space between them feels warmer for a moment.

**She** (still laughing, the sound fading): Okay fine, add some sugar now.

**He**: Nope. Drink it like this.

**She** (blinking, confused): Why?

**He** (softly): You’ll need it. Trust me.

She goes still. Her smile drops, not all at once — more like it forgets to hold on. The silence that follows isn’t empty. It’s dense. Weighty.

She looks at him. The coffee sits untouched in her hand, cooling by degrees.

---

Silence settles like fog.  
They sit across from each other, sipping coffee in an atmosphere thick with unspoken things. Their eyes meet now and then — brief, flickering contact. His gaze is measured, almost clinical; hers is softer, laced with confusion and something heavier underneath.

Two people in the same room, orbiting different thoughts.

**She** (grimacing): How the hell do you drink this bitter crap? It’s like my taste buds just signed a resignation letter.

**He** (smirking): Funny. You were chugging it like ancestral nectar just yesterday.

**She**: Exactly my point. What changed overnight?

He catches the weight in her tone. The smirk fades. He stirs his coffee slowly, the spoon clinking against the mug.

**He**: The heart… is fickle. It flips like a switch sometimes.

**She** (quietly, firmer): I didn’t think your heart was like that.  
Would you stop dodging already and just — be honest with me?

He looks up. His eyes are darker now, more direct.

**He**: How much do you even know me?

She hesitates, then lifts her chin slightly.

**She**: Not much. You never really shared anything.

**He** (raising an eyebrow): You never asked.

**She**: Oh, please. Then let me ask — how much do you know about me?

**He**: Almost everything.

She blinks. He goes on, voice casual but with an edge beneath the words.

**He**: Your childhood stories, your extended family tree, the mole on your back you think no one noticed… Your love for mangoes but hate for mango-flavored anything. The way your voice dips when you’re sad and lifts just a little when you’re faking a smile.  
I’ve paid attention.

She looks at him — really looks. Disbelief and realization wrestle behind her eyes.

**She** (softly): Then… what’s the problem?

**He** (locked on her): I don’t know.  
Maybe that’s the problem — I never *felt* anything from you. Not truly.

She looks down. That one lands.

**She** (whispers): Then why were we even in this… for a year?

He leans back, mug in hand, staring into the last bit of his coffee.

**He**: Because I thought maybe… you understood me.  
Better than anyone else did. You read between the lines. You knew what I was thinking without me saying it.  
Maybe that’s why I stayed.  
Wishful thinking, probably.

He sets the mug down gently.

**He** (continuing): But it felt like I was holding on to something that wasn’t real. A mirage. And I don’t want to drag you into a one-sided story.  
You deserve more than that.

She doesn’t respond. Just finishes the last sip of her coffee, the bitterness now blending into the quiet around her.

She turns to the window — where the mountains loom like silent witnesses and the little bird’s nest sways gently in the breeze.

He watches her. Studies her.  
Trying to decode the silence in her posture — the curve of her brow, the twitch in her lip, the grip on the mug.

She smirks. Leans in slightly.

**She** (teasing): So... have you ever felt it before? You know — that stupid little thing called love?

He raises an eyebrow. Doesn’t smile.

**He**: Yeah. I did. Once.

She straightens a bit, eyes narrowing — not with suspicion, but curiosity.

**She**: Oh? Do tell.  
You never really shared stuff like that with me. I always figured you’d get awkward if I pried too much into your past.

**He**: You had full permission to pry. You still do.  
I would've told you anything, everything — gladly.  
But you never asked.

*(pauses, a small smile flickering and fading)*  
I appreciate that, by the way.  
The way you respected my space.  
But maybe... that’s part of the reason we’re sitting here like this now.

She rolls her eyes, half-amused.

**She**: You’re acting like a kid now.

He leans back, arms behind his head.

**He**: I *am* a kid in an adult’s body. My heart still has that childlike innocence.

**She** (sarcastically): Oh yeah? That “innocence” — where was it when you made that girl’s life hell?  
Turned her into a social outcast? Gave her enough trauma to leave the university?

He chuckles. Darkly.

**He**: Damn, you’re really something.

*(pauses)*  
As for her... I can’t stand people who try to defame you.  
The kid in my heart told me to ruin her — and then promptly went on vacation.

She shakes her head, smirking despite herself.

**She**: Psychopath with morals.  
*(leans in again)*  
Alright then, Romeo — tell me about this sweetheart of yours.

---

He takes a deep breath, voice softening, the memory pulling at him.

**He**: It was during school. There was this girl in my class.  
I was painfully shy back then — barely looked people in the eye.

*(pauses)*  
She lived a block away. Sometimes we’d bump into each other on the walk to school. I never had the guts to talk to her first. But… I think she noticed.

*(half-smiles)*  
She started things — casual, harmless. Eventually, she’d hold my hand during those walks. And I’d just… follow.  
Eyes on the ground, heartbeat in my throat.

His tone turns dreamy for a second, like the memory is coloring the room.

**He**: I swear, whenever she was around, the world would blur.  
Like someone turned off the background noise — and it was just her.

**She** (cutting in, eyebrow raised):  
You *do* realize you’re talking about another girl in front of your current girlfriend?  
And you're way too happy reminiscing about it.

He snaps out of it, blinking. A little flustered now.

**He**: What I meant was… I never felt that way again. Not until—

*(pauses)*  
Well. During our farewell, she asked me, “Do you like me?”  
I nodded like a dumbass.  
She just smiled and said, “Yeah… I figured.”

That was it. No confession. No drama.  
We both walked away. Never spoke again.

She crosses her arms, eyes narrowing.

**She**: So… if you liked her that much, why didn’t you go after her?

**He** (shrugging):  
I lacked the courage.  
What if she’d said no? That *what if* was enough to stop me.

**She**: You — not going after something you wanted? That’s… new.

**He** (softly):  
Yeah. I was like that. Quiet.  
College changed that. I started shaping my character.  
Became... this version of me.

**She** (smirking):  
Hard to believe you were that guy — all timid and unsure. What a reveal.

**He** (groaning):  
Don’t make fun of me.

**She** (throwing her hands up, innocent):  
I’m not! I’m *understanding*.

*(grinning hard now)*

**He** (narrowing his eyes):  
Your face says otherwise.

She *tries* to hold a straight face. Fails completely.

**She**: Okay, okay — sorry! I couldn’t help it.

He stands, grabs both mugs, heads to the kitchen.

**She** (calling after him):  
Don’t be mad!

**He** (from kitchen):  
I’m not mad.

He comes back, brushing his hands on his jeans, settles again.  
She watches him, playful — but something searching behind the grin.

**She**: So…  
*(squints dramatically)*  
Do you still remember her? Or planning to elope?

He meets her gaze. Calm. Unreadable.

She watches the silence stretch. Then—

**She** (sharper):  
What, you had a change of heart?  
You gonna chase her again and just… shift me out of the way?

**He** (exhaling):  
It’s not like that.  
It’s been over ten years.  
She’s a ghost from a life I buried. I don’t want anything from her.

**She**:  
Then *why the fuck* do you want to break up?

*(beat)*  
Tell me. And don’t give me that “you don’t know me” crap.  
That’s bullshit.

*(leans forward)*  
I didn’t want to rush things.  
We still have a year before graduation — and a whole life beyond that.  
I thought I’d get to know you… slowly. When *you* were ready.

He stares at her. Something tight in his expression.  
Silence stretches.

**He** (quietly):  
So you really want to know?

**She** (voice dropping):  
Yes.  
Tell me honestly.

*(beat)*  
Wait…

*(squints, mock suspicious)*  
Are you… impotent?  
Is that why you’ve never tried anything with me? Hmm?

A beat. He blinks.

**He** (deadpan):  
Wow. Straight to the point, huh?

**She** (arms crossed, smirk twitching):  
I mean — I’m a thorough woman.

**He** (rubbing his temples):  
No. I’m not impotent.  
If anything, I’m… over-functional.

*(deadpan)*  
I just don’t want to be intimate with someone I’m unsure about.

**She** (soft now):  
Unsure about *me*?

**He**:  
No.  
Unsure about *myself*.  
What I feel. What I want.  
What I need.

*(beat)*  
If I’m being honest, I think I’ve always been a little broken.  
Like I wasn’t built for love — just… observation. Strategy. Distance.

*(softly)*  
I tried with you because you saw through the fog a little.  
But somewhere deep down, I knew I’d hurt you.

**She**:  
Okay wait—  
If you want me to *really* know you, then tell me—

Did you have any other relationships?  
After her?

**He** (groaning):  
Here we go…

**He**:  
Yes. Two.

**She** (narrowing eyes):  
Two??

*(gasps)*  
So you *were* a playboy!  
Playing with girls’ feelings — tossing them aside!

**He** (wounded-laugh):  
Hey! That’s harsh.

**She** (dramatic):  
Then what’s happening *right now*?

*(leans closer)*  
How long did those last?

**He**:  
A year. Maybe more.

**She** (hands to forehead):  
I *knew* it!

*(mock-faints)*  
Use-and-throw. Textbook.  
God, what did I see in you?  
Ugh — someone kill me.  
Wait — *no*. Don’t kill me.  
Beat him. Beat this playboy right here!

**He** (alarmed, laughing):  
Would you calm down?!  
You sound like a crime show monologue.

**She** (pointing at invisible jury):  
Save me from this pervert!  
Wait…

*(blinks)*  
You never even touched me like that…

**He** (arms crossed):  
Are you done?

**She** (grinning):  
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.  
Went a little overboard.

**He**:  
A little?

**She**:  
I didn’t *mean* it like that…

**He**:  
Oh? Then how *did* you mean it?

**She** (laughing, waving):  
Don’t say it again!  
Fine. Go on. Tell me about your past *romance*.

**He** (quiet):  
It wasn’t romance.  
It was… tragedy.

**She** (eyes wide):  
Oh god. Tragedy?  
Wait—  
Did you get them pregnant or something?

**He** (dead stare)

**She** (hands up):  
Okay okay! I’ll shut up.

*(zips lips)*  
Go on, you pervert playboy.

**He**:  
That’s it.

He glares. She bursts out laughing.

**He**:  
Do you want to hear it or not?

**She**:  
Okay okay okay!

*(mock zips lips again)*  
Mmm-hmm. I’m listening.

---

He, half-smiling despite himself, starts gathering his thoughts, eyes drifting into the distance.

He (softly):  
"So, it was when I was in 9th. One day I just didn’t feel like going to school... so I went to the railway station instead."

She raises an eyebrow, the glint of amusement in her eyes, already intrigued. He continues, still lost in the memory.

He:  
“I always wanted to visit NTPC — you know, the power plant? I don’t know why, it just fascinated me. So, I bought a ticket, changed into a different outfit I packed, and hopped on the train. I had two hours, and around seven hours before school ended. It felt perfect.”

She (laughing slightly):  
“Wait, wait. You... bunked school, packed a bag, and took a solo train adventure to see how electricity is made? At 14? Wasn’t that... risky?”

He grins, a little chuckle escaping him, but there’s a faraway look in his eyes as he recalls the moment.

He:  
“Well, I didn’t get kidnapped, so I guess I’m still here to tell the story.” 

She softens, watching him, still half-amused but starting to feel the weight of how much this story means to him.

She (quietly):  
“Go on.”

He exhales, leaning back slightly as he lets the memory settle in. His tone drops a little as he recalls the next part.

He:  
“Everything was fine until I reached my destination. Or, well... I thought I had. But I didn’t realize the train had arrived. So, I sat there, like an idiot, watching everyone else get off. And the train — being an express — didn’t stop again for a long time. By the time I figured it out, I was too late.”

She leans in, genuinely interested, her gaze softening.

She:  
“Oh my god. How did you not realize? How could you mess that up? You're usually so careful."

He chuckles, a bit of self-deprecating humor lacing his words.

He:  
“Well, in that moment, I wasn’t exactly the most... calculated. Panic hit me hard. People were asking me questions, and I just stared at them like I didn’t even know where I was anymore.”

She (half-worried, half-curious):  
“That’s terrifying. What did you do?”

He pauses for a beat, his smile fading just a little, eyes darkening as he remembers the panic of the moment.

He:  
“I just froze. Total blank. It was like everything I thought I knew — all the planning — went straight out the window. And school was already over, and I was still on that train.”

There’s a quiet silence between them, the weight of the situation hanging in the air. She watches him closely, her heart softening as he opens up, a vulnerability there she hasn’t seen before.

She (after a pause):  
“That... that sounds horrible.”

He gives her a tight smile, but his eyes betray the memory's impact.

He:  
“I panicked. But then... this old man sitting next to me noticed. He was calm, like nothing was wrong. He asked about my family and, weirdly enough, knew my dad when I mentioned his name. He told me to call home.”

She blinks, processing what he’s said.

She:  
“So, your dad... was calm about it?”

He nods, a slight smirk tugging at his lips.

He:  
“Yeah. The moment I called him, he just... sighed, and said, ‘Hmm, I see... well, you reap what you sow. Okay, here, talk to your mother.’ My dad was so zen about the whole thing. My mom, on the other hand... well, she wasn’t.”

She chuckles softly, though her expression is still a little concerned.

She:  
“That’s... wild. But how did they help you?”

He:  
“Dad didn’t freak out. He just told me, ‘Don’t worry. When you get to the final station, find a TT or the police. Or call me, and I’ll handle it. I’ll catch the next train to come get you.’"

She smiles faintly, impressed.

She:  
“That’s... surprisingly calm for your dad. And your mom? Was she as calm?”

He laughs, the sound rich with fondness.

He:  
“No. My mom went full emotional rollercoaster. Cried, yelled, and then I jokingly told her, ‘Hey, this might be our last call, so record it just in case you miss me.’”

She chuckles, shaking her head.

She:  
“God, you really had your hands full. But... what happened after that?”

He:  
“Long story short, the old man took the phone, spoke with my dad for a bit, and then gave it back. A while later, my dad called again and told me to go with the old man. He worked at the NTPC and knew someone in charge there. My dad had already made arrangements. The man would take me in for the night and bring me back the next day. I just had to call every hour to check in.”

She watches him, her eyes wide as she soaks in the details, the gravity of the situation unfolding before her.

She:  
“That’s... crazy. But... kind of sweet. You ended up in good hands.”

He nods, a faint smile on his lips, but there's a quiet sadness underneath it.

He:  
“Yeah. I was fine, safe, and came back the next day. But... I always remember the feeling of being completely lost. Like I had no control over what was happening.”

She (softly):  
“That’s... a lot for a 14-year-old. But I get why you don’t share it. It’s one of those memories you probably don’t want to relive.”

He nods, then leans forward, looking at her more seriously.

He:  
"Yeah... and the romance part? That came later."

She raises an eyebrow, playful, but there's a glint of curiosity there.

She:  
"Wait, romance? From the train station debacle?"

He:  
"It wasn’t like that at first. The old man had a granddaughter visiting. At first, she kept her distance, but... over time, we started talking. She showed me around, and we ended up spending hours just talking."

She leans in, intrigued, her curiosity piqued.

She:  
"And?"

He (with a faint, bittersweet smile):  
"That night, we ended up sharing the same bed. Nothing serious, but there was a connection there. She was a year older, but we just clicked."

She:  
"So, you guys stayed in touch?"

He nods, his smile fading as he remembers the next part.

He:  
"Yeah. We’d talk every night, and she even proposed to me after a while. It was... simple, pure. A long-distance thing, but it meant something."

She watches him, her voice now quieter, more careful.

She:  
"But... what happened?"

He exhales, the weight of the memory heavy on his chest.

He:  
“Things changed. Slowly. The calls started dropping off. From every day, to once in a while, to nothing at all. I tried calling her, but she wouldn’t pick up. Then, right before my board exams, she called again... and told me we couldn’t talk anymore. She was getting married.”

Her eyes widen, disbelief spreading across her face.

She:  
“What...?”

He stares at the floor for a long moment, his voice low.

He:  
“It hit me hard. I didn’t know how to react. I just... couldn’t process it. And then I gave my exams. Scored well. But it all felt pointless.”

She sits back, the room silent for a beat, the weight of his words sinking in.

She (softly):  
“That’s... tragic. I’m sorry.”

---

<!-- its done till here -->
<!-- need to start from here -->

she stays quiet for a beat, her fingers absentmindedly twirling a loose strand of hair. Then she glances up at him, eyes softer now.
she: So... she just left like that? No fight, no warning?

he lets out a dry chuckle, but there’s no humor in it. He leans back against the wall, tilts his head to look at the sky.
he: Yeah. Just one call and boom. Gone.
A pause. He exhales, slowly.
he: I mean... I get it. Maybe she had her reasons. Pressure, family, whatever. Still felt like shit though.

she nods slowly, her gaze dropping to her lap.
she: Must’ve been... hard.
Then, with a slight smirk tugging at the edge of her lips—
she: And here I thought I was the queen of teenage heartbreak. Guess you snatched the crown.

she shifts closer, her tone softening.
she: Tell me more. About your past. I want to know the person I love.

He stiffens just a little at her words—didn't see that one coming. For a moment, his eyes search hers, like he’s trying to figure out if she meant it.
he: What’s the point? We’ll both go our own ways eventually... or are you planning to gather ammo to blackmail me later?

she: Who knows? But one thing’s for sure—I'm not going anywhere. We’ll walk the same path.

He looks at her for a long moment, something unspoken flickering behind his eyes. Then he picks up his cigarette pack, taps one out with practiced fingers, lights it. The first drag hangs in the air between them.

he (half-smiling): Let’s see how long you hold onto that.

And with that, he pushes himself up and walks toward the balcony, smoke trailing behind.

she watches him go, then scoffs under her breath.
she: Where the hell are you going now, Shakespeare?

he (without turning): Thought it’d look cool if I ended the line and walked away dramatically.

she: Cool my ass! She gets up and follows him, poking his side with two fingers. Sit down and explain what that cryptic crap meant. And don’t try me, or I’ll beat you so bad you’ll cry in Morse code.

he turns to look at her, caught between amusement and disbelief, lips curling into a crooked grin.
he: You’re insane.

she: You’re welcome.

She:
“So tell me… do you still miss her? Or is it just… some leftover feeling messing with your head?”

He lets out a soft breath, not quite a sigh, just enough to fog up the silence. He leans forward, elbows on knees, staring down at his fingers like they might spell the answer out for him.

He:
“No. It’s not that. I don’t feel anything for her anymore. Or the school crush either. That chapter’s done.”
He pauses, picking at the edge of his thumbnail, then glances up at her.
“The part that messes with me… is how easily I forgot them. Like they were just… placeholders in time. Blips. Nothing.”

She studies him quietly, the way his shoulders slope just slightly when he says that. It clicks for her—what he’s really saying. That it’s not about them at all. It’s about him. The way he detaches. The way things slip through his hands and leave barely a mark.

She:
“Do you regret that?”

He leans back, arms spread across the back of the couch, eyes drifting up to the ceiling like the answers might be carved there.

He:
“I don’t know. I mean… I’m genuinely happy for them. I hope they’re doing well, living good lives. But the weird part? I can’t even remember their faces. Or their voices. It’s like… they were dreams I forgot right after waking up.”

She doesn’t speak right away. She sits beside him, tracing the lines on her palm, like looking for something there too. Then:

She (softly):
“Maybe that’s your way of surviving. Like your mind files things away when they stop mattering. Even if your heart doesn’t agree.”

He doesn’t reply, just nods a little, eyes still far off. She reaches out and gently tugs on his sleeve.

She:
“But I hope… I’m not that easy to forget.”

That brings his eyes back to her. Slowly. Like he’s coming out of a tunnel.

He:
“You won’t be. Even if I wanted to. You’re the part that doesn’t feel like a dream.”

She breaks eye contact, biting back a smile that almost slips through.

She:
“Good. 'Cause if you ever forget me, I’ll haunt you like a ghost.”

He chuckles under his breath.

He:
“That sounds about right.”

---


She:
“So tell me about the second one. Or just… tell me more about your past. I want to understand what made you think the way you do now.”

He leans back a little, smirking.
He:
“Well then, time for a flashback...”
He raises an imaginary curtain with his hands.
“So, this was around 12th grade. There was this girl in my college. Lively, charming—”

She cuts in immediately, raising an eyebrow.
She:
“Why do you always start like that? ‘Charming,’ really? You never call me charming. I get none of this praise.”

He grins, putting a hand to his chest mockingly.
He:
“Ah, forgive me, mylady. I shall rephrase for your royal standards.”

She leans back, arms crossed but amused.
She:
“Hmm. I hope so.”

He:
“So, during college, there was this girl. Not charming, not lively—just… existing. But somehow, she caught my attention. Even then, I kept my distance.”
He glances over at her for effect.
“She was friends with this other girl—technically my cousin, but the connection was buried somewhere in the ancient family tree. We all lived in the same neighborhood. So, this ‘not-so-charming’ girl used to visit often.”

She smirks, shaking her head.
She:
“Girls just keep falling into your lap, huh?”

He shrugs, chuckling.
He:
“Beats me. Honestly, I still don’t get how I pulled you. I mean, you’re a straight 10/10 baddie, and yet… here we are.”

She acts like she’s flipping her hair.
She:
“Damn right. Now keep going, I want to hear where this one crashes.”

He:
“Alright, so one day, my cousin’s mom called me over. I thought it was just some errand, but nope—both girls were sitting there, getting a lecture from aunty.”
He smiles a little at the memory.
“Apparently, since I was the ‘studious one’ with good grades, aunty thought I’d be a great tutor for both of them—Maths, Physics, Chem. And so began the evening tuition sessions at their place.”

She:
“Let me guess—fate played its role?”

He:
“Exactly. I didn’t try to mix with them, but fate clearly didn’t care. A few months in, she started getting bolder. Closer. I noticed it… but said nothing. I wanted to see how far she’d go.”

He takes a second here, remembering.

He:
“And yeah, she went far. After four-five months of tutoring and chatting more during college hours, she somehow got my number from my cousin. Started with study doubts… then flirting.”
He makes a small ‘tsk’ noise.
“And one day, she proposed. And me being the ‘go with the flow’ kind of guy… well, I got another girlfriend.”

She mock gasps.
She:
“You really are a playboy, huh?”

He:
“I’m not!”

She raises a brow, leaning toward him slightly.
She:
“Oh, but you’re walking the path. You’ve got the potential. And tell me—why is it always the girl who confesses? Even I had to confess first, if I remember correctly.”

He, grinning like a fool now:
“That’s just… the effect of my charm.”

She, narrowing her eyes:
“Cheeky little shit. Do you want me to start feeding you porridge from now on?”

He, confused:
“Wait, why?”

She:
“Because you won’t have teeth left to chew with if you keep this up.”

He bursts out laughing, trying to cover his mouth as if it would save him.


She: So what happened next? How far did you even go with her?

He: Nowhere, really. I never tend to get intimate with anyone.

She leans back, raising a brow.

She: So… she’s just like me. Just existing there.

He: Damn, that kinda stings when you put it like that.

She: Well, it’s true. You never did anything with any of them. The childhood one ghosted you. The second was long distance—so, hands-off. And this one? You’re saying you didn’t even kiss?

He: Nope.

She (mock gasps): What a waste. And here I thought you could become a legendary playboy, charming girls into bed with just a smile. But no—turns out, you haven’t even kissed anyone. Are you sure you’re not… I dunno, impotent? Or maybe gay?

He (deadpan): Okay, now you’re just being dramatic. I’m not gay. I… verified.

She (leans forward, curious): Verified? How?!

He: It's not what you're imagining. I just… wondered why I wasn’t feeling “that way” towards anyone. So one day, I watched some gay porn. Just to test. Turns out, nope—didn't like it. Actually messed me up for a few days. I couldn’t even watch regular stuff after that.

She: Hmm… interesting. Still, I think I need to verify this personally. I mean, imagine—we get married and find out you’re broken. No kids. Our families looking at us like we’re cursed.

He (half-laughing): You might have a point. Maybe we should verify.

She smirks—he’s fallen into her trap.

She: Great. Strip.

He (blinks): What?

She (unfazed): Let’s get this over with. Gotta check if the machinery’s functional.

He: Alright—wait, hold on. What the hell are you trying to do?

She: Quality inspection. Standard procedure.

He: It works, okay? I checked it last night. Fully operational.

She curses under her breath, her plan slipping.

She: Yeah, but I haven’t verified it.

He: Why do you need to verify it?

She: Because I’m your girlfriend. I have the right to know everything about you.

He: You won’t be my girlfriend for long. We’re literally talking about breaking up.

She: Yet. We're talking. Until then, I still have girlfriend privileges.

While she’s talking, she sneakily reaches for his belt. His eyes go wide.

He (startled): Hey! No! I’m not mentally prepared for this!

He scrambles away, fumbling backwards toward the door.

She: You’re acting like a maiden right now.

He: And you’re acting like a pervert out for my body!

She (grinning): Hmmm, yeah. Hahahaha!

He (half out the door, mock yelling): Someone save me from this predator!

---

She stepped forward, a glint in her eyes, and before he could react, she gently nudged him backward and shut the balcony door behind him. The click of the latch echoed louder than expected in the stillness.

He looked around—the narrow balcony, the quiet street below, the fading sky. He sighed.
No escape. No backup plan. Just her, inside, with that mischievous look in her eyes.

He muttered under his breath, “She wouldn’t actually try undressing me out here… would she?”
Then a second thought hit.
“…Wait. She might.”

He: “What do you want?”

She leaned against the glass, voice low now, not teasing but calm—intentional.
She: “I want you.”

His eyes narrowed.
He: “Yeah… that’s not something I can give. Pick something else.”

She didn’t miss a beat, pointing toward the lower half of his body with mock seriousness.
She: “Then I want that.”

He: “That’s off-limits.”

She: “Then I’ll take it by force.”

Cornered, he exhaled and dropped the facade. No more dodging, no more snark.
He straightened, stepped forward slowly.

She: (raising a brow) “So… you’ve surrendered?”

But he said nothing—just kept walking toward her. Not aggressive, not tense—just… quiet.

Something in his expression made her pulse still. The fire behind her teasing dimmed into confusion, then softened into something else. She instinctively backed up, unlocking the door and stepping aside.

And that’s when he pulled her into a hug—firm, steady, unexpected.

She froze for half a second, not understanding… then melted into it without asking questions. She rested her chin near his shoulder, arms sliding around him gently.

She: “Don’t worry. Nothing’s gonna happen. And even if it does, we’ll face it together. I’m not letting go.”

He pulled her just a little closer, his voice barely above a whisper.

He: “I believe you. Just… don’t leave me like the others.”

She smiled softly against his neck.

She: “That’s not happening. You’re stuck with me now. Like a leech.”

He chuckled through his nose, a breath of warmth in her hair.

Later, they returned to the room, the night quieter now—like even time had slowed down to watch them. She sat over him, sideways on the chair, legs curled gently as he pulled her in close, arms around her like instinct. It was their first time being this physically close, skin brushing, breaths syncing, her hair occasionally tickling his face in the breeze from the open window.

Her perfume—soft and floral—mixed with something uniquely her. It grounded him and sent his thoughts into a haze he didn’t fully understand yet.

She smiled faintly, watching him absentmindedly play with the strands of her hair as he spoke. That smile... it sent a flutter through him.

He (softly): “So yeah, just like that… we began dating. She proposed, we met often at college, nothing felt drastically different for me, but for her… everything shifted. She looked at me more often, smiled more. We started sharing lunch under a tree—simple meals, split in halves. My sister would show up sometimes, and we’d act like nothing was going on. But I think she had a hunch. She knew her friend was acting different.”

She nodded, listening, arms draped lazily over his shoulders.

He (continuing): “After class, we’d go to the park nearby—me, her, and my sister. It became our routine. Everything was just… calm. Sometimes, we’d see couples kissing—playing with their mouths.”

She (grinning): “Wait. Playing with mouths? What even is that?”

He (mock shocked): “You’re surprisingly innocent, especially after what you tried earlier.”

She turned to look at him, confused. Their faces were inches apart.

He gently touched her lips, a light press of his fingers.

He: “It’s a French kiss. No hands involved. Just two people digging for treasure in each other’s mouths.”

She (gagging playfully): “Yuck! What the hell is that description? I feel like throwing up now.”

He (nodding): “Exactly the feeling I get when people talk about kissing.”

She: “You make it sound like a health hazard.”

He (grinning like a mad scientist): “It is! A germ-sharing ritual. Viruses, bacteria, exchange of salivas. Disgusting.”

She smirked. A dangerous one.

He noticed—too late.

Before he could piece it together, she was already in motion, facing him fully in his lap. One hand on his cheek, the other slipping into his hair. And then—she kissed him.

He froze.

Tried to resist, to say something clever—but his brain short-circuited. And just like that, all defenses were gone. He surrendered.

They kissed.

Slowly at first, then deeper—tongues colliding, not in battle, but in exploration. For the first time, he let instinct take over, and she met it halfway. Warm. Hungry. Gentle. Wild.

When they finally parted, she was grinning.

She: “Hmm… I can now confirm, your machine isn’t faulty.”

He blinked, still dazed.

She (with a wicked smile): “I also feel something rising… and it’s definitely not the Shield Hero.”

He groaned, throwing his head back.
He: “Another soldier lost… without even drawing a sword.”

She leaned forward, resting her forehead against his.
She (softly): “Don’t worry. I’ll heal you after battle.”

She:
"So… how was it? Your first kiss?"

He:
"I don't even have the words. But I will say this—fuck those scientists and doctors who said kissing is unhygienic and unhealthy. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever felt. Honestly, I think they just never got to experience it themselves, so they decided to slander it. And like an idiot, I believed them."

She (laughs):
"You really let it all out, huh? Well then, from now on, kiss me more often. I'm not taking the lead every single time."

He (a bit shy):
"Yes, my lady… as you wish."

She (smiling warmly):
"I'm glad you never gave it to anyone else. Thank them, actually, for not stealing it from me. I’m the one who got to have your first time… that’s something special."

(She leans in a little closer, but her smile fades slightly as she asks the next question.)

She:
"So… what happened? Why did you two break up?"

He:
"It was because of her. I kept telling her to focus on her studies, to not lose sight of what matters… but after she proposed, it was like nothing else existed for her anymore. She stopped paying attention in class, kept daydreaming, glancing at me instead of at the board, always planning our next park visit or movie night instead of prepping for exams.

Then board exams hit. I passed with good grades… she failed. I tried to push her, to motivate her, helped her prepare for the compartment exam—but she failed again. Eventually… her father had enough. He got her married off."

(He looks down for a second, then forces a bitter smile.)

He:
"I think I’m cursed. Everyone who falls in love with me ends up married… just not to me."

(She stays quiet for a moment, then looks at him with a teasing but sad smile.)

She:
"Let’s see… your school crush ghosted you. The long-distance one got married. Now your college sweetheart too… Maybe it's my turn now?"

He:
"And that’s exactly why I told you we should break up. I don’t want to watch it happen again. I can't go through that again."


She (leans back slightly on his lap, playing with his fingers):
"You know… sometimes I wonder if people like us are meant to last. Not because there’s something wrong between us… but because the world just doesn’t seem to allow it."

He (quietly, eyes on the floor):
"Yeah. It’s like… every time I feel something real, it slips through my fingers. I hold on tight, but the world just finds a way to take it away."

She:
"And still, you keep trying. Even when you told me to break up, I knew you didn’t want that… not really."

He:
"It’s not about wanting. It’s about preparing. If history repeats, then what’s the point of getting attached to something I might lose again?"

She (softly):
"But what if this time, history needs rewriting?"

He (sighs):
"That’s easy to say now. But time… time wears everything down. One day it’s distance. The next, it's circumstances. Family. Careers. Expectations. You never know what hits you next."

She:
"And what if we get hit… and we don’t break?"

(He looks at her, surprised by her words. She’s not smiling now. She's serious. Grounded. Certain.)

He:
"You really believe that?"

She:
"I don’t believe it. I choose it. There’s a difference."

(A pause. The breeze hits them again, brushing her hair over his face. He closes his eyes. She gently brushes the strands away.)

She (with a small laugh):
"You think I’m scared of a little bad luck? C’mon… I’ve already kissed you. That’s like signing a contract with fate."

He (half-smiling):
"Then we’re both doomed."

She (grinning):
"Then we’ll be doomed together."

(The silence between them grows tender. The heaviness of the conversation lingers, but it no longer feels like a burden — more like something shared, something lighter now that it’s out in the open.)

He (softly):
"You really mean it, don’t you?"

She (nods, gently resting her forehead against his):
"Every word. I’m not running. Not now. Not ever."

(He lifts his hand, brushing her cheek, his thumb tracing the edge of her lips.)

He (barely audible):
"I never thought someone would stay."

She (smiling):
"Then I’ll just have to keep proving you wrong."

(She leans in slowly, and this time the kiss is different. Not hurried, not impulsive — it’s slower, deeper, filled with a silent promise. His hands hold her like she’s something fragile yet fierce. Her fingers tangle in his hair, pulling him closer for a moment longer.)

(When they part, their breaths are still tangled, and she lingers for just a heartbeat more before slowly rising from his lap.)

She:
"I should go. My roommate's already suspicious… and if she finds out I’m not in the dorm, she’ll think I’m out committing war crimes."

He (half-laughing, still catching his breath):
"Tell her you were. Emotionally."

She (grinning as she fixes her hair):
"Only on you."

(She walks to the door, then pauses and looks back, eyes softer than ever.)

She:
"Don’t overthink tonight, okay? Just… hold onto how it felt."

He:
"I will. Promise."

She (with a wink):
"And maybe next time, you take the lead."

(And with that, she slips out of the room quietly, leaving behind the scent of her perfume and a thousand thoughts buzzing in his mind. He watches the door for a moment longer before leaning back in his chair, eyes closed — heart full, mind racing.)

He sat in the quiet, her perfume lingering like a question he couldn’t answer, then reached for his phone.

He calls his friend.

dk: Hello?

He: Where are you?

dk: Near the shopping complex. Do i Need to grab something for you.

He: Hmm. I wanna get drunk tonight.

dk: What? Why?

He: Just… I don’t know. I need something hard.

dk: I’m with her right now, can’t leave immediately. But I’ll call vir and ask him to bring you something.

He: Alright. Just make sure it hits hard.

dk: Something happened?

He: …Hmm.

dk: Wait, I’m coming right now.

He: It’s not urgent. Are you staying at her place tonight?

dk: No, I’ll drop her off and come to you.

dk's girlfriend: What’s going on? Are you going somewhere?

dk: Yeah, I won’t be staying tonight.

He: You don’t have to come. Just ask someone to get me a bottle.

dk: Bro, you can’t even tolerate water with spice. I’m not letting you drink alone.

He: You act like my mom sometimes.

dk: Well, she did tell me to look after you.

He: …Alright. I’ll wait.


The night air was cool against her skin as she walked back, the memory of his lips still burning, her steps heavier than they should’ve been.
On her way back, she gets a call from her roommate.

naina: Where are you? You’re not back yet?

She: I’m on my way. By the way Do we have any liquor in the room?

naina: Yeah, I brought a bottle today. We were about to start.

She: Don’t start without me. I need it more than all of you combined.

naina: Damn. What happened? Don’t tell me he dumped you.

She: No… but he was going to.

naina: Ugh, I told you. All guys are the same. They just want the body.

She: It’s not like that. Just… leave it. I’ll explain later. I’ll be there in five mins.

naina: Alright, we’re waiting.



\[INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT\]

The room looked like a battlefield of broken cravings—empty pizza boxes stacked like crooked monuments to laziness, a flickering bulb swinging gently, casting warped shadows across the peeling walls. A musty haze of alcohol, sweat, and the kind of silence that follows emotional storms clung to the air like humidity.

He was sprawled on the old couch like a body dumped there by fate, a half-finished bottle of whiskey cradled in one hand, his glass dangling between two fingers like a dying cigarette.

dk sat cross-legged on the dusty floor, a bottle of beer resting on his knee, head tilted like he was trying to solve a riddle. vir, already a few shots deep, was lounging on a high stool near the broken window, grinning like a fox who’d found the henhouse.

dk: (watching him down another swig)
“So you’re already halfway through that bottle, and still haven’t said a word. Spill it.”

vir: (snorts)
“He got dumped. Look at him—he’s got that dead-fish-on-a-frying-pan energy.”

dk: (choking on laughter)
“Stop it! Don’t kill me while I’m drinking!”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he turned his face toward the window, staring at the moon as if it might blink back at him. A faint, helpless smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

vir: (nudging dk)
“Look at that. He’s smiling like an idiot. Nah, they didn’t break up.”

dk: (squinting)
“Yeah… you're right. That’s not heartbreak. That’s the look of someone who just floated out of a dream.”

He: (still looking out the window, voice quiet)
“Don’t bother me for a bit. Just... let me feel this for a while.”

vir: (grinning)
“Oh ho ho! I think I know exactly what's happening here.”

dk: “Oh, please, enlighten us, O great love guru.”

vir: (bowing like a sage)
“Yes, my child. After deep meditation and two tequila shots, I have seen the truth, this man has achieved Nirvana.”

dk: (eyes wide, playing along)
“Oooh, sensei! What is Nirvana?”

vir: (sipping solemnly)
“Nirvana, my child, is the sacred state achieved when two souls unite in physical cardio under the divine protection of a blanket.”

dk: “Wait... isn’t that just sex?”

vir: (slamming his hand down dramatically)
“Blasphemy! How dare you reduce the sacred art of Nirvana to such crude words! You have insulted the temple!”

dk: (panicking, laughing)
“I’m sorry, guruji! Forgive this foolish disciple!”

He: (finally turning, a tired smile on his lips)
“Can you both shut up for a second? And no, we didn’t do that.”

vir: (smirking)
“Of course you didn’t. No sane girl would let you do that.”

dk: (losing it, bursting into laughter)
“He got you there, man.”

He: (smiling faintly, but there's a shadow under it)
“You know what’s wild? I finally found someone who makes me feel… calm. Not excited. Not scared. Just… still.”

dk: (more sober now)
“And that scared you?”

He: (nods slowly)
“Yeah. Because every time I’ve felt like this before... it ended badly. My school crush ghosted me, the long-distance one got married off, and now this one’s ready to fight fate just to stay with me. I’m scared I’ll ruin her too.”

vir: (softening)
“Maybe this time, don’t pull away. Maybe it’s not about avoiding the fall... maybe it’s about learning to land.”

dk: (lifting his beer)
“To learning how to land.”

He: (clinking glasses)
“To not being a curse anymore.”

vir: (grinning)
“To Nirvana... someday.”



She reached her dorm, knocked once.

The door creaked open and Naina stood there, leaning slightly on the frame, hair tied in a loose bun, expression unreadable.

Naina:
“You’re late.”

fl walked in without answering, eyes drifting to the table — bottles already out, packet of chips torn open, glasses half-prepped. They’d been waiting.

The room is dim, one lamp switched on with a soft yellow glow. There’s an open window letting in a little breeze, a bottle of vodka on the floor with a few packets of chips scattered around.

fl: (tiredly)
“Yeah. Today was... hectic.”

She toed off her shoes slowly, each movement dragging. Pulled off her top and tossed it toward her chair before slipping into her old hoodie, the one that always hung off one shoulder.

Simran, who was sitting cross-legged on the bed, shifted a little.

Simran:
“Where were you though? You never stay out this long.”

fl: (pulling her hair up in a bun, not looking at them)
“To the usual place.”

Simran: (teasing)
“Oooh, did he not let you leave, or was it you who didn’t want to come back, hmm?”

fl: (reaches for the bottle, expression flat)
“It’s not like that. I’m just tired, Simran. Don’t poke me. Let me drink in peace for a while.”

Naina watched her quietly as she poured herself a shot — not bothering to mix, not bothering to sit down either.

Naina:
“Okay, drink all you want. Sleep like a log after. But first... spill what happened.”

Simran sat up straighter like a child being told a bedtime story was about to begin. That familiar mischievous glint in her eyes.

fl: (pours, chugs without a blink)
“Not in the mood.”

Simran: (blinks)
“Wait, that was a straight shot? No mix? Whoa.”

fl: (wiping her mouth with the back of her sleeve)
“I said don’t poke me.”

She finally sat on the floor, back resting against her bed, legs outstretched. The bottle sat beside her now like some old friend she didn’t really trust.

Naina raised her eyebrows.

Naina:
“What’s with you acting like a drunk uncle at a wedding?”

fl: (quietly, like to herself)
“That’s the shit.”

Simran took a tiny sip from her own glass, frowned.

Simran:
“This one burns. What brand is this? You changed it?”

Naina: (munching a chip)
“She said she wanted something hard. So not the usual. It’s heavier.”

Simran:
“Damn. What kinda emotional earthquake needs this level of alcohol?”

She turned to Naina with exaggerated suspicion.

Simran:
“She told you something, right? Don’t lie. What happened? Why is she drinking like her soul left her body?”

Naina: (nonchalant)
“Something like... she got dumped?”

Simran: (eyes widening)
“Ohhh. That explains everything.”

fl: (not even turning)
“I’m not dumped. You’re dumped.”

Simran: (grinning)
“Sure, baby. Keep telling yourself that. He used you and ghosted you. Classic move.”

fl: (sharp now)
“Simran. Shut up.”

A brief silence. Simran looked toward Naina and grinned under her breath.

Naina: (whispers)
“Wait for it. Give her one more drink. She’s already wobbling.”

Simran: (murmuring)
“She’s gonna drop a truth bomb soon. I can feel it.”

Naina took another sip, watching fl carefully like a cat waiting for a mouse to twitch.

Naina:
“You should eat something too. You’re drinking too fast.”

Simran:
“I agree. This one’s not juice. You’ll pass out before we get any gossip.”

fl reached for another shot, poured it with shaky hands. She didn’t speak. Just stared at the liquid like it might say something back.

Naina leaned in slightly.

Naina:
“You sure you don’t wanna mix something in? Or are you aiming to forget your own name tonight?”

fl looked up, eyes red-rimmed — not from crying, just tired.

fl:
“I don’t need anything. Just leave me alone for a bit.”


Simran kept fiddling with the edge of her glass, side-eyeing fl like she was trying to decode a foreign script.

Simran:
“You’re too quiet. It’s weird. You usually get chatty after the second shot.”

fl didn’t respond. She was still staring at the floor, back against the bed, shoulders slumped. Not sad exactly — just heavy.

Naina:
“She’s not gonna talk like this. She needs a trigger.”

Simran: (grinning)
“You want me to slap her?”

fl: (dry)
“I’ll throw you off the balcony.”

Simran: (mock offended)
“Wow. So violent. And here I was about to offer emotional support.”

Naina: (sipping slowly)
“Maybe emotional support is the problem.”

fl: (exhales)
“Guys, I said drop it—”

Simran:
“We will. We totally will. After you answer at least one question.”

fl: (leans her head back, eyes closed)
“You both are like mosquitoes. Buzzing till you get slapped.”

Naina: (calmly)
“Then slap us. But spill something first.”

Simran: (leans forward, hands clasped)
“Fine. Let’s start easy. Did you two fight?”

fl: (quietly)
“No.”

Naina:
“Then what? Did he say something weird? flirt with someone else? Did you flirt with someone else?”

Simran:
“Oooh. Did you try to make him jealous? Like old-school tactics?”

fl: (opens one eye)
“God, no. That’s so... eighth grade.”

Simran:
“Then what?”

fl: (shrugs)
“He said... something odd. That’s all.”

Naina:
“Odd like how?”

fl: (hesitating)
“Just... stuff about his past. His life.”

Simran: (already invested)
“Ah-ha. Family drama?”

fl: (nope)
“No.”

Naina: (thoughtful)
“Ex-girlfriends?”

fl: (pauses)
“...Yeah. That.”

Simran:
“Ohhhh. How many are we talking here? Two? Three? A football team?”

fl: (rubbing her temple)
“Three.”

Simran: (clapping her hands)
“Bingo! I knew it. I smelled history.”

Naina:
“Three is not insane. Could be worse.”

Simran: (to Naina)
“Yeah but he’s got that mysterious vibe, you know? The kind of guy who says ‘I’ve loved and lost’ and then stares at the rain dramatically.”

fl: (half-laughs)
“He doesn’t stare at rain. He just... goes quiet.”

Naina:
“So what? Did one of them cheat on him?”

fl: (murmuring)
“One ghosted him. Second ran away. Third failed and got married off.”

Simran: (sits up, wide-eyed)
“Wait wait wait. Ran away from him or with someone?”

fl:
“From home.”

Simran:
“Holy shit. What is he? A Bollywood test?”

Naina: (frowning)
“So all of them left? And now he thinks you’ll leave too?”

fl nods.

Simran: (mock gasp)
“He thinks you are going to get married?”

fl:
“Not exactly. He just... thinks everyone who loves him ends up leaving. Or being taken.”

Naina:
“Dude. That's not a curse. That’s depression.”

Simran:
“Okay but like... he seriously thought of breaking up just to avoid watching you leave later?”

fl: (nods again, slower this time)
“Yeah. He thought... maybe it’s better to push me away now.”

Simran: (picks up a chip, stares at it)
“That’s so messed up. Romantic, but messed up.”

Naina: (quietly)
“So what did you say?”

fl: (sips again, then smirks)
“I kissed him.”

Simran: (spits out her drink)
“WHAT—”

fl:
“Twice.”

Naina: (finally smiling)
“And then?”

fl: (leans her head back)
“He shut up.”

Simran: (laughing)
“You shut him up with lips. Powerful move.”

Naina: (pointing a chip at her)
“You sure you’re not the one who cursed him now?”

Simran:
“Or maybe you're his final boss. After three failed relationships, the game throws you in.”

fl: (quietly, still smiling)
“Maybe.”

Simran: (suddenly serious)
“Wait. You didn’t sleep with him, right?”

fl: (opens one eye)
“No.”

Simran:
“Good. Don’t do it when he’s in this weird state. Boys say all kinds of stuff post-tragedy.”

Naina: (sipping, thoughtfully)
“I don’t think he’s being manipulative. Just scared.”

fl: (nodding)
“He’s not a bad guy. Just tired.”

Simran: (laying back on the floor)
“We all are, babe.”
